**Meep** is a free and open-source software package for [electromagnetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism) simulation via the [finite-difference time-domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-difference_time-domain_method) (FDTD) method.

## Features

-   **Free and open-source software** under the [GNU GPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License).
-   Complete **scriptability** via [Python](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python_Tutorials/Basics/), [Scheme](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Scheme_Tutorials/Basics), or [C++](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/master/C++_Tutorial/) APIs.
-   Simulation in **1d, 2d, 3d**, and **cylindrical** coordinates.
-   Distributed memory **parallelism** on any system supporting [MPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPI).
-   Portable to any Unix-like operating system such as [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macOS), and [FreeBSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD).
-   **Precompiled binary packages** of official releases and nightly builds via [Conda](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation/#conda-packages).
-   Arbitrary **anisotropic** electric permittivity ε and magnetic permeability μ, along with **dispersive** ε(ω) and μ(ω) including loss/gain, **nonlinear** (Kerr & Pockels) dielectric and magnetic materials, electric/magnetic **conductivities** σ, and **saturable** gain/absorption.
-   **Perfectly-matched layer** (**PML**) absorbing boundaries as well as **Bloch-periodic** and perfect-conductor boundary conditions.
-   Exploitation of **symmetries** to reduce the computation size, including even/odd mirror planes and 90°/180° rotations.
-   Arbitrary current sources including a [guided-mode launcher](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python_Tutorials/Eigenmode_Source/).
-   Frequency-domain solver for finding the response to a [continuous-wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_wave) (CW) source.
-   ε/μ and field import/export in the [HDF5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDF5) data format.
-   **GDSII** file import for planar geometries.
-   **Materials library** containing predefined broadband, complex refractive indices.
-   Field analyses including [Poynting flux](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python_Tutorials/Basics/#transmittance-spectrum-of-a-waveguide-bend), [mode decomposition](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python_Tutorials/Mode_Decomposition/) (for [S-parameters](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python_Tutorials/GDSII_Import/)), energy density, [near to far transformations](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python_Tutorials/Near_to_Far_Field_Spectra/), [frequency extraction](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python_Tutorials/Basics/#modes-of-a-ring-resonator), [local density of states](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python_Tutorials/Local_Density_of_States/) (LDOS), [modal volume](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python_User_Interface/#field-computations), [Maxwell stress tensor](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python_Tutorials/Optical_Forces/), [arbitrary functions](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Field_Functions/); completely programmable.
