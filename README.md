Meep (or MEEP) is a free finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)
simulation software package to model electromagnetic systems.

The latest documentation is available on [readthedocs](http://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

To compile directly from the git repository, you need to run
```
sh autogen.sh
make
```
in the cloned directory in order to generate the necessary files. You will need GNU autotools and SWIG installed, among other packages.
