  There are several possible scenarios when material grids overlap -- these
  different scenarios enable different applications.

  For U_MIN: Where multiple grids overlap, only those grids that contribute
  the minimum u contribute, and for other grids the gradient is zero.
  This unfortunately makes the gradient only piecewise continuous.

  For U_PROD: The gradient is multiplied by the product of u's from
  overlapping grids, divided by the u from the current grid.  This
  unfortunately makes the gradient zero when two or more u's are zero,
  stalling convergence, although we try to avoid this by making the
  minimum u = 1e-4 instead of 0.

  For U_MEAN: The gradient is divided by the number of overlapping grids.
  This doesn't have the property that u=0 in one grid makes the total
  u=0, unfortunately, which is desirable if u=0 indicates "drilled holes".

  For U_DEFAULT: Expect the default behavior with libctl objects; that is
  the object on top always wins and everything underneath is ignored.
  Specifically, that means that u = the top material grid value at that point.
