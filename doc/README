This is the documentation tree for MEEP.

markdown (.md) files are in the doc/docs/.

To build and visualize the HTML documentation locally using the
mkdocs package (useful for verifying changes on your local machine
before committing), first install `mkdocs` (version 0.17.5) as
well as two auxiliary packages via e.g.:

% pip3 install --user mkdocs==0.17.5 python-markdown-math mkdocs-material

To (re)generate the Python API documentation (extracted from the docstrings)
run this command in the project root folder:

% python generate_py_api.py

Rerun this after making any changes to the docstrings in the source and
rebuilding the project, in order to update the documentation.

Next, run the following command from the top-level MEEP repository tree:

% mkdocs serve

Finally, open the following address in a browser window:

http://127.0.0.1:8000

This launches a web server on your local machine
plus a filesystem hook for rebuilding the documentation
tree automatically whenever any .md file is modified.
This enables viewing the HTML documentation in real time
as the source files are edited.

To build the HTML version of the documentation, run:

% mkdocs build

The results will be put into the ./doc/site folder.

Alternatively, the project Makefile can also be used to build the
documentation and to build a distribution archive containing the
documentation. To do so, run one of the following commands from the
top-level MEEP repository tree:

% make docs

or

% make docs-dist
