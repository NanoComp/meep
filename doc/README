This is the documentation tree for MEEP.

markdown (.md) files are in the doc/docs/.

To build and visualize the HTML documentation locally using the
mkdocs package (useful for verifying changes on your local machine
before committing), first install `mkdocs` (version 0.17.5) as
well as two auxiliary packages via e.g.:

% pip3 install --user mkdocs=0.17.5 python-markdown-math mkdocs-material

Next, run the following command from the top-level MEEP repository tree:

% mkdocs serve

Finally, open the following address in a browser window:

http://127.0.0.1:8000

This launches a web server on your local machine
plus a filesystem hook for rebuilding the documentation
tree automatically whenever any .md file is modified.
This enables viewing the HTML documentation in real time
as the source files are edited.
