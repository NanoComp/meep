 **Meep** is a free and open-source software package for simulating electromagnetic systems via the [finite-difference time-domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-difference_time-domain_method) (FDTD) method. Meep is an acronym which officially stands for *MIT Electromagnetic Equation Propagation*. Features include:

-   **Free and open-source software** under the [GNU GPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License).
-   Complete **scriptability** via [Python](Python_Tutorials/Basics), [Scheme](Scheme_Tutorials/Basics), or [C++](C++_Tutorial) APIs.
-   Simulation in **1d, 2d, 3d**, and **cylindrical** coordinates.
-   Distributed memory **parallelism** on any system supporting [MPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPI).
-   Portable to any Unix-like operating system such as [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macOS), and [FreeBSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD).
-   Arbitrary **anisotropic**, electric permittivity ε and magnetic permeability μ, along with **dispersive** ε(ω) and μ(ω) including loss/gain, **nonlinear** (Kerr & Pockels) dielectric and magnetic materials, and electric/magnetic **conductivities** σ.
-   **PML** absorbing boundaries and/or perfect conductor and/or **Bloch-periodic** boundary conditions.
-   Exploitation of **symmetries** to reduce the computation size &mdash; even/odd mirror symmetries and 90°/180° rotations.
-   Field output in the [HDF5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDF5) standard scientific data format.
-   Arbitrary current sources including a guided-mode launcher.
-   Frequency-domain solver for finding the response to a continuous-wave source.
-   Field analyses including flux spectra, near to far field transformations, modal depcomposition, frequency extraction, local density of states, modal volume, Maxwell stress tensor, arbitrary functions; completely programmable.

Time-Domain Simulation
----------------------

A time-domain electromagnetic simulation simply takes [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations) and evolves them over time within some finite computational volume, essentially performing a kind of **numerical experiment**. This can be used to calculate a wide variety of useful quantities. Major applications include:

-   **Transmission and Reflection Spectra** &mdash; by Fourier-transforming the response to a short pulse, a single simulation can yield the scattering amplitudes over a wide spectrum of frequencies.
-   **Resonant Modes and Frequencies** &mdash; by analyzing the response of the system to a short pulse, one can extract the frequencies, decay rates, and field patterns of the harmonic modes of lossy and lossless systems including waveguide and cavity modes.
-   **Field Patterns** (e.g. Green's functions) &mdash; in response to an arbitrary source via a [continuous-wave (CW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_wave) (fixed-$\omega$) input.

Meep's scriptable interface makes it possible to combine many sorts of computations along with multi-parameter optimization etcetera in sequence or in parallel.

[Tutorial/Basics](Python_Tutorials/Basics.md) provides examples of all these kinds of computations.
