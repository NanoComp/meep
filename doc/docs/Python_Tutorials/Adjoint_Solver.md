# Adjoint Solver
---

Meep contains an adjoint-solver module for efficiently computing the
gradient of an arbitrary function of the mode coefficients
($S$-parameters), DFT fields, local density of states (LDOS), and
"far" fields with respect to $\varepsilon$ on a discrete spatial grid
(a [`MaterialGrid`](../Python_User_Interface.md#materialgrid) class
object) at multiple frequencies over a broad bandwidth. Regardless of
the number of degrees of freedom for the grid points, just **two**
distinct timestepping runs are required. The first run is the
"forward" calculation to compute the objective function and the DFT
fields of the design region. The second run is the "adjoint"
calculation to compute the gradient of the objective function with
respect to the design variables. The adjoint run involves a special
type of current source distribution used to compute the DFT fields of
the design region. The gradient is computed in post processing using
the DFT fields from the forward and adjoint runs. The gradient
calculation is fully automated. The theoretical and computational
details of the adjoint-solver module are described in this
publication:

  S. E. Ralph, “[High-performance hybrid time/frequency-domain
  topology optimization for large-scale photonics inverse
  design](https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.442074),” *Optics Express*,
  vol. 30, no. 3, pp. 4467–4491 (2022).

Much of the functionality of the adjoint solver is implemented in
Python using [autograd](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd) as well as
[JAX](https://github.com/google/jax).

The adjoint solver supports inverse design and [topology
optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology_optimization) by
providing the functionality to wrap an optimization library around the
gradient computation. The adjoint solver also supports enforcing
minimum feature sizes on the optimal design in 1D (line width and
spacing) and 2D (arbitrary-shaped holes and islands). This is
demonstrated in several tutorials below.

Broadband Waveguide Mode Converter with Minimum Feature Size
------------------------------------------------------------

This example demonstrates some of the advanced functionality of the
adjoint solver including worst-case (minimax) optimization across
multiple wavelengths, multiple objective functions, and design
constraints on the minimum line width and line spacing. The design
problem involves a broadband waveguide mode converter in 2D with
minimum feature size. This is based on [M.F. Schubert et al., ACS
Photonics, Vol. 9, pp. 2327-36,
(2022)](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsphotonics.2c00313).

The mode converter must satisfy two separate design objectives: (1)
minimize the reflectance $R$ into the fundamental mode of the input
port ($S_{11}$) and (2) maximize the transmittance $T$ into the
second-order mode of the output port ($S_{21}$). There are different
ways to define this multi-objective and multi-wavelength
optimization. The approach taken here is *worst-case* optimization
whereby we minimize the maximum (the worst case) of $R$ and $1-T$
across six wavelengths in the $O$-band for telecommunications. This is
known as *minimax* optimization. The fundamental mode launched from
the input port has $E_z$ polarization given a 2D cell in the $xy$
plane.

The challenge with minimax optimization is that the $\max$ objective
function is not everywhere differentiable. This property would seem to
preclude the use of gradient-based optimization algorithms for this
problem which involves twelve independent functions ($R$ and $1-T$ for
each of six wavelengths). Fortunately, there is a workaround: the
problem can be reformulated as a differentiable problem using a
so-called "epigraph" formulation: introducing a new "dummy"
optimization variable $t$ and adding each independent function
$f_k(x)$ as a new nonlinear constraint $t \ge f_k(x)$. See the [NLopt
documentation](https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/NLopt_Introduction/#equivalent-formulations-of-optimization-problems)
for an overview of this approach. The minimax/epigraph approach is
also covered in the [near-to-far field
tutorial](https://nbviewer.org/github/NanoComp/meep/blob/master/python/examples/adjoint_optimization/06-Near2Far-Epigraph.ipynb).

In this example, we use a minimum feature size of 150 nm for the
linewidth *and* linespacing. The implementation of these constraints
in the adjoint-solver module is based on [A.M. Hammond et al., Optics
Express, Vol. 29, pp. 23916-38
(2021)](https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.431188).

There are six important items to highlight in the set up of this
optimization problem:

1. The lengthscale constraint is activated only in the final epoch. It
   is often helpful to binarize the design using a large $\beta$ value
   for the projection operator (hyperbolic tangent) before this final
   epoch. This is because the lengthscale constraint forces
   binarization which could induce large changes in an initial
   grayscale design and thus irrevocably spoil the performance of the
   final design. Note that regardless of the value of $\beta$,
   projecting the design weights $u$ will produce grayscale values
   between 0 and 1 whenever $u \approx \eta \pm \frac{1}{\beta}$.

2. The initial value of the epigraph variable of the final epoch (in
  which the minimum feature size constraint is imposed) should take
  into account the value of the constraint itself. This ensures a
  feasible starting point for the [method of moving asymptotes (MMA)
  optimization
  algorithm](https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/NLopt_Algorithms/#mma-method-of-moving-asymptotes-and-ccsa),
  (which is based on the conservative convex separable approximation
  (CCSA) algorithm).

3. The edge of the design region is padded by a filter radius (rather
  than e.g., a single pixel) to produce measured minimum feature sizes
  of the final design that are consistent with the imposed constraint.

4. The hyperparameters of the feature-size constraint function
  (`a1`, `b1`, and `c0` in the `glc` function of the script below), need to
  be chosen carefully to produce final designs which do not
  significantly degrade the performance of the unconstrained designs
  at the start of the final epoch.

5. Damping of the design weights is used for the early epochs in which
  the $\beta$ parameter of the projection function is small (< ~50) and
  the design is mostly grayscale in order to induce binarization.

6. The subpixel-smoothing feature of the [`MaterialGrid`](../Python_User_Interface.md#materialgrid)
  is necessary whenever the $\beta$ parameter of the projection function
  is large (> ~50) and thus the design is binary (or nearly so). Without
  subpixel smoothing, then the gradients are nearly zero
 except for $u \approx \eta \pm 1/\beta$ where the derivatives
 and second derivatives blow up, causing optimization algorithms to break down. When subpixel
  smoothing is enabled (`do_averaging=True`), the weights are projected
  *internally* using the `beta` parameter. For this reason, any
  preprocessing (i.e., mapping) of the weights outside of the `MaterialGrid`
  should apply only a filter to the weights but must not perform any
  projection.

A schematic of the final design and the simulation layout is shown
below. The minimum feature size of the final design, measured using a
[ruler](https://github.com/NanoComp/photonics-opt-testbed/tree/main/ruler),
is 165 nm. This value is consistent with the imposed constraint since
it is approximately within one design pixel (10 nm).

![](../images/mode_converter_sim_layout.png#center)

A plot of the reflectance and transmittance spectrum in linear and log
(dB) scales of the final design is shown below. The worst-case
reflectance is -17.7 dB at a wavelength of 1.295 μm. The worst-case
transmittance is -2.1 dB at a wavelength of 1.265 μm.

![](../images/mode_converter_refl_tran_spectra.png#center)

A plot of the objective-function history (worst case or maximum value
across the six wavelengths) for this design is also shown. The
"spikes" present in the plot are a normal feature of
nonlinear-optimization algorithms. The algorithm may take too large a
step which turns out to make the objective function worse. This means
the algorithm then has to "backtrack" and take a smaller step. This
occurs in the CCSA algorithm by increasing a penalty term. Also, even
though the worst-case objective function is constant during most of
the first epoch which may indicate the optimizer is making no
progress, in fact the optimizer is working to improve the objective
function at the other (non worst-case) wavelengths.

![](../images/mode_converter_objfunc_hist.png#center)

Finally, here are additional designs generated using constraints on
the minimum feature size of 50 nm, 70 nm, 90 nm, and 225 nm. The
designs with smaller minimum feature sizes are clearly distinguishable
from the designs with the larger ones.

![](../images/mode_converter_designs.png#center)

The table below shows a comparison of the imposed constraint on the
minimum feature size of the optimizer versus the measured minimum
linewidth and linespacing for the five designs presented in this
tutorial. There is fairly consistent agreement in the constraint and
measured values except for the design with the largest minimum feature
size (225 nm vs. 277 nm). For cases in which the measured minimum
feature size is significantly *larger* than the constraint used in the
optimization, this could be an indication that the final design can be
improved by a better choice of the hyperparameters in the feature-size
constraint function. Generally, one should expect the constraint and
measured values to agree within a length of about one to two
design-region pixels (10 nm, in this example).

| constraint (nm) | measured linewidth (nm) | measured linespacing (nm) |
|:---------------:|:-----------------------:|:-------------------------:|
|        50       |            85           |             60            |
|        70       |           103           |             85            |
|        90       |           109           |            134            |
|       150       |           221           |            165            |
|       225       |           277           |            681            |

Finally, a plot of the worst-case reflectance and transmittance versus
the imposed constraint on the minimum feature size is shown below for
the five designs. The general trend of decreasing performance (i.e.,
increasing reflectance and decreasing transmittance) with increasing
minimum feature size is evident.
