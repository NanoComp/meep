# Frequency Domain Solver
---

This tutorial demonstrates Meep's [frequency-domain solver](../Python_User_Interface/#frequency-domain-solver) which is used to compute the fields produced in a geometry in response to a [continuous-wave (CW) source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_wave). For more details regarding what this feature is and how it works, refer to this [FAQ](../FAQ/#what-is-meeps-frequency-domain-solver-and-how-does-it-work). This example involves using the frequency-domain solver to compute the fields of a ring resonator which has been described in a [separate tutorial](Basics/#modes-of-a-ring-resonator). We will verify that the error in the computed fields decreases monotonically with decreasing tolerance of the iterative solver.

Only two changes are necessary to the [original simulation](https://github.com/stevengj/meep/blob/master/python/examples/ring.py) which involved time-stepping the fields in response to a broadband source: (1) replace the Gaussian-pulse source with a [continuous source](../Python_User_Interface/#continuoussource), and (2) turn on complex fields since, by default, real fields are used. Everything else remains unchanged.

Since the frequency-domain solver uses an [iterative method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_method), there are two things we can do to improve its convergence: (1) use a non-zero smoothing width (default is 0) for the CW source to reduce the high-frequency oscillations produced by its abrupt turn on (which have slow group velocities and are absorbed poorly by [PML](../Perfectly_Matched_Layer/)), and (2) increase the value of $L$ (default is 2) which is one of the parameters used in the [BiCGSTAB-L](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biconjugate_gradient_stabilized_method) iterative solver.

We will use the frequency-domain solver to compute the fundamental mode at five different tolerance values on a logarithmic scale. We will plot the L2 norm of the difference of the fields at the first four tolerances with the fields at the lowest tolerance as a function of the tolerance. The simulation script and the resulting plot are shown below.

```

The inset of the figure below shows the magnitude of the E$_z$ field, computed using a tolerance of 10$^{-12}$, overlapping the ring-resonator geometry. Note the three-fold mirror symmetry of the field pattern and presence of the point source. The error in the fields decreases monotonically with decreasing tolerance of the frequency-domain solver.
