# Frequency Domain Solver
---

This tutorial demonstrates Meep's [frequency-domain solver](../Python_User_Interface.md#frequency-domain-solver) which is used to compute the fields produced in response to a [continuous-wave (CW) source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_wave). For a description of its inner workings, see Section 5.3 ("Frequency-domain solver") of [Computer Physics Communications, Vol. 181, pp. 687-702, 2010](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/~oskooi/papers/Oskooi10.pdf). This example involves using the frequency-domain solver to compute the fields of a ring resonator which is described in [Tutorial/Basics](Basics.md#modes-of-a-ring-resonator). First, we will verify that the error in the fields decreases monotonically with decreasing tolerance of the iterative solver. And then, we will demonstrate qualitative agreement with the frequency-domain fields computed using a different method: [Fourier transforming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform) the time-domain fields in response to a narrowband Gaussian-pulse source.

Usage of the frequency-domain solver involves only two changes to the [original simulation](https://github.com/NanoComp/meep/blob/master/python/examples/ring.py): (1) replace the pulse source with a [continuous source](../Python_User_Interface.md#continuoussource), and (2) turn on complex fields since real fields are used by default. Everything else remains unchanged.

Since the frequency-domain solver uses an [iterative method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_method), there are a couple of things we can do to improve its convergence properties: (1) use a non-zero smoothing width for the CW source (default is 0) to reduce the high-frequency oscillations produced by its abrupt turn on which have slow group velocities and are absorbed poorly by [PML](../Perfectly_Matched_Layer.md), and (2) increase the $L$ parameter of the [BiCGSTAB-L](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biconjugate_gradient_stabilized_method) iterative solver from the default of 2 to 10.

We compute the fundamental mode at five different solver tolerances chosen on a logarithmic scale. We will then plot the L2 norm of the error in the fields as a function of the tolerance.

The simulation script is in [examples/solve-cw.py](https://github.com/NanoComp/meep/blob/master/python/examples/solve-cw.py). The notebook is [examples/solve-cw.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/NanoComp/meep/blob/master/python/examples/solve-cw.ipynb).

    sim.solve_cw(tols[i], 10000, 10)
    ez_dat[:,:,i] = sim.get_array(vol=vol, component=mp.Ez)

plt.imshow(ez_data.transpose(), interpolation='spline36', cmap='Reds', alpha=0.9)
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()

if np.all(np.diff(err_dat) < 0):
    print("PASSED solve_cw test: error in the fields is decreasing with increasing resolution")
else:
    print("FAILED solve_cw test: error in the fields is NOT decreasing with increasing resolution")
```

The results are shown in the figure below. The error in the fields decreases monotonically with decreasing tolerance of the frequency-domain solver.

As a further validation of the frequency-domain solver, we will compare its fields with those computed using time-stepping. This involves taking the Fourier transform of E<sub>z</sub> via the `add_dft_fields` routine. After the time stepping, the frequency-domain fields are accessed using [`get_dft_array`](../Python_User_Interface.md#array-slices).

```py
sim.reset_meep()

src = mp.Source(mp.GaussianSource(fcen,fwidth=df),
                component=mp.Ez,
                center=mp.Vector3(r+0.1))

sim = mp.Simulation(cell_size=mp.Vector3(sxy,sxy),
                    geometry=[c1,c2],
                    sources=src,
                    resolution=10,
                    symmetries=[mp.Mirror(mp.Y)],
                    boundary_layers=[mp.PML(dpml)])

dfts = sim.add_dft_fields([mp.Ez], fcen, fcen, 1, where=vol)

sim.run(until_after_sources=100)

eps_data = sim.get_array(vol=vol, component=mp.Dielectric)
ez_data = np.absolute(sim.get_dft_array(dfts, mp.Ez, 0))

plt.figure()
plt.imshow(eps_data.transpose(), interpolation='spline36', cmap='binary')
plt.imshow(ez_data.transpose(), interpolation='spline36', cmap='Reds', alpha=0.9)
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

The left inset of the figure above shows the magnitude of the scalar E<sub>z</sub> field, computed using the frequency-domain solver with a tolerance of 10<sup>-12</sup>, superimposed on the ring-resonator geometry. Note the three-fold mirror symmetry of the field pattern (fundamental mode) and trace of the point source. The right inset is for the Fourier-transformed fields of the time-domain calculation. The results are qualitatively similar.
