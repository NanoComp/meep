# Frequency Domain Solver
---

This tutorial demonstrates Meep's [frequency-domain solver](../Python_User_Interface/#frequency-domain-solver) which is used to compute the fields produced in a geometry in response to a [continuous-wave (CW) source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_wave). For details regarding this feature, refer to this [FAQ](../FAQ/#what-is-meeps-frequency-domain-solver-and-how-does-it-work). This example involves using the frequency-domain solver to compute the fields of a ring resonator which has been described in a [separate tutorial](Basics/#modes-of-a-ring-resonator). First, we will verify that the error in the computed fields decreases monotonically with decreasing tolerance of the iterative solver. And then, we will demonstrate qualitative agreement with the frequency-domain fields computed using a different method: [Fourier-transforming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform) the time-domain fields in response to a narrowband Gaussian-pulse source.

Usage of the frequency-domain solver involves only two changes to the [original simulation](https://github.com/stevengj/meep/blob/master/python/examples/ring.py): (1) replace the Gaussian-pulse source with a [continuous source](../Python_User_Interface/#continuoussource), and (2) turn on complex fields since, by default, real fields are used. Everything else remains unchanged.

Since the frequency-domain solver uses an [iterative method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_method), there are a couple of things we can do to improve its convergence: (1) use a non-zero smoothing width for the CW source (default is 0) to reduce the high-frequency oscillations produced by its abrupt turn on (which have slow group velocities and are absorbed poorly by [PML](../Perfectly_Matched_Layer/)), and (2) increase the $L$ parameter of the [BiCGSTAB-L](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biconjugate_gradient_stabilized_method) iterative solver (default is 2).

We will compute the fundamental mode at five different tolerance values chosen on a logarithmic scale. We will then plot the L2 norm of the error in the fields as a function of the tolerance. The simulation script is shown below.

```py
import meep as mp
import numpy as np
from numpy import linalg as LA
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

n = 3.4
w = 1
r = 1
pad = 4
dpml = 2

sxy = 2*(r+w+pad+dpml)

c1 = mp.Cylinder(radius=r+w, material=mp.Medium(index=n))
c2 = mp.Cylinder(radius=r)

fcen = 0.118
df = 0.08
src = mp.Source(mp.ContinuousSource(fcen,fwidth=df), mp.Ez, mp.Vector3(r+0.1))

sim = mp.Simulation(cell_size=mp.Vector3(sxy,sxy),
                    geometry=[c1,c2],
                    sources=[src],
                    resolution=10,
                    force_complex_fields=True,
                    symmetries=[mp.Mirror(mp.Y)],
                    boundary_layers=[mp.PML(dpml)])

num_tols = 5
tols = np.power(10, np.arange(-8.0,-8.0-num_tols,-1.0))
ez_dat = np.zeros((122,122,num_tols), dtype=np.complex_)

for i in range(num_tols):
    sim.init_fields()
    sim.solve_cw(tols[i], 10000, 10)
    ez_dat[:,:,i] = sim.get_array(center=mp.Vector3(), size=mp.Vector3(sxy-2*dpml,sxy-2*dpml), component=mp.Ez)

err_dat = np.zeros(num_tols-1)
for i in range(num_tols-1):
    err_dat[i] = LA.norm(ez_dat[:,:,i]-ez_dat[:,:,num_tols-1])

plt.figure(dpi=100)
plt.loglog(tols[:num_tols-1], err_dat, 'bo-');
plt.xlabel("frequency-domain solver tolerance");
plt.ylabel("L2 norm of error in fields");
plt.show()

eps_data = sim.get_array(mp.Vector3(), mp.Vector3(sxy-2*dpml,sxy-2*dpml), mp.Dielectric)
ez_data = np.absolute(ez_dat[:,:,num_tols-1])

plt.figure(dpi=100)
plt.imshow(eps_data.transpose(), interpolation='spline36', cmap='binary')
plt.imshow(ez_data.transpose(), interpolation='spline36', cmap='Reds', alpha=0.9)
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()

if np.all(np.diff(err_dat) < 0):
    print("PASSED solve_cw test: error in the fields is decreasing with increasing resolution")
else:
    print("FAILED solve_cw test: error in the fields is NOT decreasing with increasing resolution")
```

The results are shown in the figure below. The error in the fields decreases monotonically with decreasing tolerance of the frequency-domain solver.

As a further validation of the frequency-domain solver, we will compare its fields with those computed using time-stepping. This involves taking the Fourier transform of $E_z$ via the `add_dft_fields` routine. At the end of the time stepping, these frequency-domain fields are then output to an HDF5 file via `output_dft`. The script is extended as follows. 

```py
sim.reset_meep()

src = mp.Source(mp.GaussianSource(fcen,fwidth=df), mp.Ez, mp.Vector3(r+0.1))

sim = mp.Simulation(cell_size=mp.Vector3(sxy,sxy),
                    geometry=[c1,c2],
                    sources=[src],
                    resolution=10,
                    symmetries=[mp.Mirror(mp.Y)],
                    boundary_layers=[mp.PML(dpml)])

dfts = sim.add_dft_fields([mp.Ez], mp.Volume(center=mp.Vector3(), size=mp.Vector3(sxy-2*dpml,sxy-2*dpml)), fcen, fcen, 1)
sim.run(until_after_sources=100)
sim.output_dft(dfts, "dft_fields")

import h5py

f = h5py.File("dft_fields.h5", 'r')
ezi = f["ez_0.i"].value
ezr = f["ez_0.r"].value
ez_dat = ezr + 1j * ezi

eps_data = sim.get_array(mp.Vector3(), mp.Vector3(sxy-2*dpml,sxy-2*dpml), mp.Dielectric)
ez_data = np.absolute(ez_dat)

plt.figure(dpi=100)
plt.imshow(eps_data.transpose(), interpolation='spline36', cmap='binary')
plt.imshow(ez_data.transpose(), interpolation='spline36', cmap='Reds', alpha=0.9)
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

The left inset of the figure above shows the magnitude of the scalar E$_z$ field, computed using the frequency-domain solver with a tolerance of 10$^{-12}$, superimposed on the ring-resonator geometry. Note the three-fold mirror symmetry of the field pattern (fundamental mode) and faint presence of the point source. The right inset is for the Fourier-transformed fields of the time-domain calculation. The results are qualitatively similar.
