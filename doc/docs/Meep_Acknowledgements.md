We are also grateful to Prof. J. D. Joannopoulos for his continuing support and advice in this and all our endeavors.

Alejandro Rodriguez was a patient early beta tester of many features.

We are also grateful to the authors of earlier [Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran) FDTD programs that were used in our group, which were invaluable as benchmarks in testing our new code. This includes a 2d FDTD code by Jerry Chen, with later improvements by Shanhui Fan, SGJ, and others. There was also a 3d code initially written by Shanhui Fan, with later improvements by Daniel Abrams, Doug Allan, SGJ, Chiyan Luo, and Elefterios Lidorikis.
