# Field chunks, DFT chunks, symmetries, and all that
---

As discussed in the
[meep paper](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/~oskooi/papers/Oskooi10.pdf),
meep subdivides geometries into "chunks." Each chunk is a contiguous region
of space&mdash;a line, rectangle, or parallelepiped for 1D, 2D, or 3D
Cartesian geometries, or an annular section in a cylindrical geometry&mdash;whose
sizes are automatically determined by `libmeep.`
In [parallel meep calculations](/Parallel_Meep.md), each chunk is assigned,
in its entirety, to precisely one process---that is, no chunk exists partly
on one processor and partly on another.

Many internal operations in meep boil down to looping over points in the
finite-difference grid, generally performing some operation involving the field
components and material parameters at each point.
In principle, this is just the CS 101 task of writing
1-, 2-, or 3-dimensional nested `for` loops; in practice,
it is complicated by several factors, including the following:

+ For calculations that [exploit symmetry](/Exploiting_Symmetry.md), only a
portion of the full grid is actually stored in memory, and obtaining values
for field components at a point that *isn't* stored requires a tricky
procedure (discussed [below](#HandlingSymmetries)).

+ Similarly, for Bloch-periodic geometries, only grid points in the unit cell
are stored, but we may want the fields at a point lying outside the unit cell,
again requiring a bit of a shell game to process correctly.

+ Because of the staggered nature of the [Yee grid](/Yee_Lattice.md),
"looping over grid points" can mean multiple things---are we visiting
only **E**-field sites, or only **H**-field sites, or both? Either
way, obtaining a full set of field-component values at any one grid point
necessarily involves a certain average over neighboring grid points.

To shield developers from the need to grapple with these complications
when implementing loops over grid points, `libmeep` provides
a convenient routine called `loop_in_chunks` and a set of macros
that take care of many of the above hassles. This is discussed in more
detail below.

## Chunk data structures

For each chunk in a geometry, `libmeep` creates instances of
the data structures `structure_chunk` (storing data on the
geometry of the chunk and the material properties at grid
points in the chunk) and `fields_chunk` (storing the actual values
of the time-domain field components at grid points in the chunk).
Frequency-domain (DFT) field components are handled by a separate
data structure called `dft_chunk.` Each instance of `dft_chunk`
is associated with a single instance of `fields_chunk` (namely,
whichever one stores the time-domain fields at the grid points
covered by the DFT chunk); however, because DFT fields are typically
only tabulated on a subset of the full grid, the grid volume
covered by a `dft_chunk` may be only a subset of the volume
covered by its parent `fields_chunk`, and not all `fields_chunks`
have `dft_chunks` associated with them.

## Chunking of a 2-dimensional geometry

Our running example throughout this page will be a 2D geometry,
of dimensions $(L_x, L_y)=(8,6)$, with PML layers of thickness 1
on all sides, discretized with 5 points per unit length
to yield a 40 &times; 30 grid.

### Chunking in the single-processor case

In a single-processor run, `libmeep` subdivides this geometry
into 9 chunks (click for larger image):

<p align="center"> <a href="/images/Chunks_NP1.png"><img src="/images/Chunks_NP1.png" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'/></a></p>

(The width of the 8 chunks around the perimeter is set by the PML thickness.)

Note that the chunks are not of uniform sizes and that their
*ordering* is somewhat arbitrary; in particular,
consecutive chunks are not necessarily adjacent.

#### Some per-chunk statistics

As noted above, each chunk is a contiguous region of space defined
by a Cartesian product of intervals for each coordinate; to specify
the extents of the chunk it thus suffices to specify the endpoints
of the interval for each coordinate, or equivalently the coordinates
of the lower-left and upper-right grid points in the chunk. For each
chunk, these are represented by `ivecs` named `is` and `ie`
(stored in the `fields_chunk` and `dft_chunk` structures).
Here's an example of how this looks for chunk 3 in the figure
above:

<p align="center"> <a href="/images/ChunkStatistics.png"><img src="/images/ChunkStatistics.png" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'/></a></p>

In this case we have `is=(29,-29)` and `ie=(39,-19)`.

### Chunking in the multiprocessor case

When running in parallel mode, each of the chunks identified for the
single-processor case may be further subdivided into new chunks which
can be assigned to different processors.
For example, on a run with 8 processors, the 9 chunks identified
in the single-processor case become 24 chunks:

<p align="center"> <a href="/images/Chunks_NP8.png"><img src="/images/Chunks_NP8.png" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'/></a></p>

In this image, grid points with different $z$ coordinates (different
heights off the $xy$ plane) are handled by different processors,
while points with the same $z$ coordinate but different colors
live in different chunks. In this case, processes 0, 2, 5, and 7
each own 4 chunks, while processes 1, 3, 4, and 6 each own 2 chunks.

## Handling of symmetries

Meep's approach to handling symmetries is discussed
from the user's perspective in the
["Exploiting Symmetry" section of the meep manual](/Exploiting_Symmetry.md)
and from a high-level algorithmic perspective in the
[meep</span> paper](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/~oskooi/papers/Oskooi10.pdf).
Here we'll give a brief synopsys of the implementation of this
feature.

+ The action of the symmetry group classifies grid points into *orbits,*
  sets of grid points that transform into one another under symmetry
  transformations. For example, in the figure with XY mirror symmetry below,
  the orbit of
  $\mathbf{x}_a$ is $\{\mathbf{x}_a, \mathbf{x}_b, \mathbf{x}_c, \mathbf{x}_d\}$.
  Meep chooses one element from each orbit (the "parent" grid point)
  to serve as a representative of the orbit, with the remaining elements of
  the orbit classified as "children" equivalent to the parent under
  the group action.
  (Any point in the orbit could serve equally well as the parent;
   the convention in meep is to choose the point with the lowest (most negative)
   grid indices, i.e the point closest to the lower-left corner of the overall
   grid---$\mathbf{x}_a$ in this case---but nothing depends on this particular choice.)

+ For each orbit, field components are only stored for the parent, not for
  any children. This reduces memory requirements by a factor $M$,
  the number of points in each orbit, known in meep as the ``multiplicity''
  of the symmetry; for example, $M=2$ for a geometry with *Y*-mirror symmetry,
  $M=4$ for an *XY*-mirror symmetry, $M=N$ for an *N*-fold rotational
  symmetry, etc.

+ Loops over grid points run only over parent points, i.e. points with field
  components stored in memory. However, each parent point is now visited
  $M$ times, once for each distinct symmetry transformation
  $\mathcal{S}_m (m=1,\cdots,M) $ in the symmetry group
  (including the identity transformation). On the $m$th visit to a given
  parent point $\mathbf{x}_p$, we

    **1)** look up the components of the fields $\mathbf{E}_p, \mathbf{H}_p$
           stored in memory for $\mathbf{x}_p$,

    **2)** apply the transformation $\mathcal{S}_m$ to both the grid-point
           coordinates and the field components of the parent point to yield
           the coordinates and field components of the $m$th child point, i.e.
           $$       \mathbf{x}_{cm} = \mathcal{S}_m \mathbf{x}_p,
             \quad \mathbf{E}_{cm} = \mathcal{S}_m \mathbf{E}_p,
             \quad \mathbf{H}_{cm} = \mathcal{S}_m \mathbf{H}_p.
           $$
          [If the materials are anisotropic (i.e. the permittivity and/or permeability
           are tensors) we must transform those appropriately too.]

    **3)** use the coordinates and field components of the child point to carry
           out the operation in question.

### Chunking in the presence of symmetries

As noted above, in the presence of symmetries only a portion of the
full grid is actually stored in memory. For example, adding a *Y* mirror
symmetry (symmetry under reflection about the $x$-axis) eliminates
points in the upper half-plane $(y>0)$; the points that remain are
now subdivided into 6 chunks (in the single-processor case):

<p align="center"> <a href="/images/Chunks_YSymmetry.png"><img src="/images/Chunks_YSymmetry.png" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'/></a></p>

Adding an *X* mirror symmetry on top of this (so that now the geometry has
both *X* and *Y* mirror symmetry) reduces the number of stored grid points by an
additional factor of 2; now the geometry is subdivided into just 4 chunks
in the single-processor case:

<p align="center"> <a href="/images/Chunks_XYSymmetry.png"><img src="/images/Chunks_XYSymmetry.png" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'/></a></p>

In these figures, points in shaded regions are "children"---that is, points
for which meep stores no field components, since they are related by symmetry
to "parent" points in the unshaded region. In the second figure we have
indicated one complete orbit: parent point $\mathbf{x}_a$ is carried to
child points $\{\mathbf{x}_b, \mathbf{x}_c, \mathbf{x}_d\}$ under the
operations of the symmetry group.

### Getting coordinates and field components for symmetry-reduced points

Symmetry transformations in `libmeep` are described by a class called
simply `symmetry,` which offers class methods for transforming grid
points and field components:

```c++

  symmetry S = mirror(X,gv) + mirror(Y,gv);    // XY mirror symmetry

  ivec iparent;                                // grid indices of parent point
  vec  rparent;                                // cartesian coordinates of parent point

  ...

  ivec ichild = S.transform(iparent, +1);      // grid indices of child point
   vec rchild = S.transform(rparent, +1);      // cartesian coordinates of child point

  component cchild  = Ex;                      // desired field component at child point
  component cparent = S.transform(cchild, -1); // corresponding component at parent point
```

## The `loop_in_chunks` routine

To allow developers to implement loops over grid points without
stressing out over the various complications outlined above,
the `fields` class in `libmeep` offers a convenient method called
`loop_in_chunks.`

To use this routine, you will first write a "chunk-loop function"
which carries out some operation involving grid points and (optionally)
field components at grid points. Then you pass your routine to
`loop_in_chunks` with some additional arguments customizing the
type of loop you want (see below). Your loop function will then be
called once for every `chunk` in the problem---including both
chunks whose fields are present in memory, and those
whose aren't due to being eliminated by symmetry---with a long list
of arguments describing the chunk in question.

The body of your chunk-loop function will typically want to execute
a loop over all grid points in the chunk. This is facilitated by a host
of utility macros and API functions that operate on the arguments to your function
to yield quantities of interest: grid-point coordinates, field-component
values, etc.

### The chunk loop function

The chunk-loop function that you write and pass to `loop_in_chunks`
has the following prototype:

```c++
void field_chunkloop(fields_chunk *fc, int ichunk, component cgrid, ivec is, ivec ie,
                     vec s0, vec s1, vec e0, vec e1, double dV0, double dV1,
                     ivec shift, std::complex<double> shift_phase,
	             const symmetry &S, int sn, void *chunkloop_data);
```

Notwithstanding this formidable-looking beast of a calling convention,
most of the arguments here are things that you can blindly pass on to
API functions and convenience macros, which will return quantities whose
significance is easy to understand.

Here's a skeleton chunk-loop function
that executes a loop over all grid points in the chunk,
obtaining on each loop iteration both the integer indices and the cartesian
coordinates of the child point, as well as values for a list
of field components of interest (specified before the loop in the
constructor of `chunkloop_field_components`). You can fill in the rest of the loop body
to do whatever you want with `ichild,` `rchild,` and `data.values,` and the
results will be identical whether or not you declare symmetries when
defining your geometry. (Well, the results will be identical assuming
the physical problem you're considering really is symmetric, which
[meep does not check](/Exploiting_Symmetry.md).)

```c++
void my_chunkloop(fields_chunk *fc, int ichunk, component cgrid, ivec is, ivec ie,
                  vec s0, vec s1, vec e0, vec e1, double dV0, double dV1,
                  ivec shift, std::complex<double> shift_phase,
	          const symmetry &S, int sn, void *chunkloop_data)
{
  // some preliminary setup
  vec rshift(shift * (0.5*fc->gv.inva));  // shift into unit cell for PBC geometries

  // prepare the list of field components to fetch at each grid point
  component components[] = {Ex, Hz};
  chunkloop_field_components data(fc, cgrid, shift_phase, S, sn, 2, components);

  // loop over all grid points in chunk
  LOOP_OVER_IVECS(fc->gv, is, ie, idx)
   {
     // get grid indices and coordinates of parent point
     IVEC_LOOP_ILOC(gv, iparent);  // grid indices
     IVEC_LOOP_LOC(gv, rparent);   // cartesian coordinates

     // apply symmetry transform to get grid indices and coordinates of child point
     ivec ichild = S.transform(iparent, sn) + shift;
     vec rchild = S.transform(rparent, sn) + rshift;

     // fetch field components at child point
     data.update_values(idx);
     std::complex<double> Ex = data.values[0],
                          Hz = data.values[1];
   }
}
```

## Is there a version `loop_in_chunks` for `dft_chunks`?

No, but the routine `process_dft_component()` in `src/dft.cpp` effectively
implements such a routine for a hard-coded set of operations on DFT
components (namely: outputting to HDF5, fetching DFT array slices,
and computing mode-overlap coefficients).

## How the pictures were drawn

The images above were obtained with the help of a simple C++ code
called `WriteChunkInfo` that calls `libmeep` API functions to
obtain info on the chunk structure of the 40&times;30 grid
we considered. This code (plus a simple hand-written `Makefile`)
lives in the `doc/docs/Developer_Codes` subdirectory of the meep source
distribution.
