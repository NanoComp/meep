Meep originated as part of graduate research at MIT with initial contributions by [Steven G. Johnson](http://math.mit.edu/~stevenj/), [Ardavan Oskooi](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/~oskooi/), [David Roundy](http://physics.oregonstate.edu/~roundyd/), [Mihai Ibanescu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mihai-ibanescu-2b147825/), and [Peter Bermel](http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~pbermel/). Currently, the Meep project is maintained by [Simpetus](http://www.simpetus.com) and the open-source community on [GitHub](https://github.com/stevengj/meep).

Referencing

We kindly request that you cite the following reference in any publication for which you use Meep:

- A.F. Oskooi, D. Roundy, M. Ibanescu, P. Bermel, J.D. Joannopoulos, and S.G. Johnson, [MEEP: A flexible free-software package for electromagnetic simulations by the FDTD method](http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.cpc.2009.11.008), Computer Physics Communications, vol. 181, pp. 687-702 (2010). ([pdf](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/~oskooi/papers/Oskooi10.pdf))

If you want a one-sentence description of the algorithm for inclusion in a publication, we recommend something like:

- Simulations were performed with the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method [ref FDTD], using a freely available software package [ref Meep].

General references on the FDTD method include, for example:

Financial Support
-----------------

Meep's continued development has been supported by a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 award from the National Science Foundation (NSF) under award number [1647206](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1647206). Initial development was supported in part by the Materials Research Science and Engineering Center program of the NSF under award numbers DMR-9400334 and DMR-0819762, by the Army Research Office through the Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies under DAAD-19-02-D0002, and DARPA under N00014-05-1-0700 administered by the Office of Naval Research.

We are also grateful to the authors of earlier Fortran FDTD programs that were used in our research group at MIT, which were invaluable as benchmarks in testing our new code. This includes a 2d FDTD code by Jerry Chen, with later improvements by Shanhui Fan, Steven G. Johnson, and others. There was also a 3d code initially written by Shanhui Fan, with later improvements by Daniel Abrams, Doug Allan, Steven G. Johnson, Chiyan Luo, and Elefterios Lidorikis.
