Meep originated as part of graduate research at [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology) with initial contributions by [Steven G. Johnson](http://math.mit.edu/~stevenj/), [Ardavan Oskooi](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/~oskooi/), [David Roundy](http://physics.oregonstate.edu/~roundyd/), [Mihai Ibanescu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mihai-ibanescu-2b147825/), and [Peter Bermel](http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~pbermel/). Currently, the Meep project is maintained by [Simpetus](http://www.simpetus.com) and the open-source developer community on [GitHub](https://github.com/stevengj/meep). [Christopher Hogan](https://github.com/ChristopherHogan) and [M.T. Homer Reid](http://homerreid.dyndns.org/) have lead the development of the [Python interface](Python_User_Interface).

We kindly request that you cite the following technical reference in any work for which you use Meep:

- A.F. Oskooi, D. Roundy, M. Ibanescu, P. Bermel, J.D. Joannopoulos, and S.G. Johnson, [MEEP: A flexible free-software package for electromagnetic simulations by the FDTD method](http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.cpc.2009.11.008), Computer Physics Communications, Vol. 181, pp. 687-702, 2010 ([pdf](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/~oskooi/papers/Oskooi10.pdf)).

If you want a one-sentence description of the algorithm for inclusion in a publication, we recommend something like:

- Simulations were performed with the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method [ref FDTD], using an open-source software package [ref Meep].

General references on the FDTD method include, for example:
