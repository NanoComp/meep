Meep Design
-----------

An overview of Meep's inner workings is summarized in [Computer Physics Communications, Vol. 181, pp. 687-702, 2010](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/~oskooi/papers/Oskooi10.pdf). This page is a supplement which provides a description of the source code.

### Data Structures and Chunks

Meep employs several data structures declared in `meep.hpp`. The principal data structure element is the **chunk**. A chunk is a contiguous rectangular portion of the computational grid. For example, when Meep runs on a parallel system, each process gets one or more disjoint chunks of the grid. There are several different types of chunks:

-   `fields` and `fields_chunks`
-   `structure` and `structure_chunks`
-   `dft` and `dft_chunks`

As an example, the `fields` class encapsulates the simulated fields over the entire grid, and one of its members is an array of `fields_chunk` variables that the grid is divided into. The `fields_chunk` variables are where the field is actually stored. Every parallel process has a nearly-identical fields variable with a nearly-identical list of chunks. Chunks on one process which have been assigned to another process do not store their fields arrays, and are just placeholders.

If a given material or field is not present in a given chunk, it need not be stored. For this reason, the PML boundary regions are separated into their own chunks, even on one processor, in order that the extra data for PML need not be stored for the whole grid.

In the future, we may implement support for different chunks with different resolution, to allow nonuniform spatial resolution.

Similarly for `structure` and `structure_chunks`, except that it is only for materials parameters such as epsilon, etc. and not for simulated fields.

`dft_chunk` stores accumulated Fourier-transformed fields corresponding to a given chunk.

### `grid_volume` and `volume`

The `volume` class declared in `meep/vec.hpp` represents a rectangular box-like region, parallel to the $XYZ$ axes, in "continuous space" &mdash; i.e. the corners can be at any points, not necessarily grid points. This is used, for example, whenever you want to specify the integral of some quantity (e.g., flux, energy) in a box-like region, and Meep interpolates from the grid as necessary to give an illusion of continuity.

The `grid_volume` class declared in `meep/vec.hpp` is a box of pixels. It stores the resolution, the number of pixels in each direction, the origin, etcetera. Given a `grid_volume`, there are functions to get the `volume` corresponding to the bounding box, etcetera. There is a `grid_volume` object associated with the whole computational grid, and with each chunk in the grid. There are various tricky aspects to the `grid_volume`. One is associated with the Yee grid: it has to know about different field components stored at different points. Another is associated with the fact that boundary conditions, not only the overall grid boundaries but also boundaries between chunks, are handled by an extra layer of "not-owned" pixels around the boundaries. So each chunk's `grid_volume` has "owned" grid points that the chunk is responsible for updating, and "not-owned" grid points that are updated using the boundary conditions. And thanks to the Yee grid which complicates everything in FDTD, unfortunately, the set of owned and not-owned coordinates is different for each field component. The `grid_volume` class keeps track of all this.

### File Organization

The Meep C++ source code is organized into the following files in the `src/` directory. For the Scheme interface and how it communicates with the back-end C++, look up the source code in the `libctl/` directory under the Meep package root directory.

The following table briefly describes what is in each .cpp file:

Deprecated Interfaces
---------------------

Beware that some of the interfaces in the source code and in the old manual are now deprecated, as they have been superseded by newer features and may be removed at some point.

In particular, you should probably avoid:

-   The `monitor_point` class. Just declare an array to store the fields you want, get them with `fields::get_field`, and analyze them with `do_harminv`. Or, to accumulate the DFT as you run, use the `dft_chunk` class via `fields::add_dft`.
-   Slice and EPS output. This has been superseded by HDF5 output, which is much more flexible and efficient.
