As a clarification, we should note that Python and Scheme control (ctl) files, written by the user which do not contain code distributed with Meep and loaded at runtime by the Meep software, are *not* derived works of Meep and do *not* fall thereby under the restrictions of the GNU General Public License. On the other hand, C++ programs linked with the Meep libraries *are* derived works, and you must obey the terms of the GPL if you wish to distribute programs based in part on Meep. You are not affected for programs you do not distribute.
