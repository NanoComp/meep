Precompiled Packages for Ubuntu
-------------------------------

Precompiled packages of Meep version 1.3 (September 2017) are available for [Ubuntu](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=meep). We recommend Ubuntu as Meep and all of its dependencies can be installed using just one line:

```sh
sudo apt-get install meep h5utils
```

You can also install the parallel version of Meep which is based on [OpenMPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/) using:

```sh
sudo apt-get install meep-openmpi
```

The Meep package for Ubuntu is in the process of being updated and will likely appear in Ubuntu 19.10 as derived from the [Debian package](https://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=names&keywords=meep).
