# Cylindrical Coordinates
---

Meep supports the simulation of Maxwell's equations in [cylindrical coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylindrical_coordinate_system) for structures that have continuous rotational symmetry around the *z* axis. This reduces problems in 3d to 2d, and 2d to 1d, if there is sufficient symmetry.
