        + **`direction` [`direction` constant ]** — Specify the direction of the
          boundaries to put the PML layers next to. e.g. if `X`, then specifies PML on the
          $\\pm x$ boundaries (depending on the value of `side`, below). Default is the
          special value `ALL`, which puts PML layers on the boundaries in all directions.

        + **`side` [`side` constant ]** — Specify which side, `Low` or `High` of the
          boundary or boundaries to put PML on. e.g. if side is `Low` and direction is
          `meep.X`, then a PML layer is added to the $-x$ boundary. Default is the special
          value `meep.ALL`, which puts PML layers on both sides.

        + **`R_asymptotic` [`number`]** — The asymptotic reflection in the limit of
          infinite resolution or infinite PML thickness, for reflections from air (an
          upper bound for other media with index &gt; 1). For a finite resolution or
          thickness, the reflection will be *much larger*, due to the discretization of
          Maxwell's equation. Default value is 10<sup>−15</sup>, which should suffice for
          most purposes. You want to set this to be small enough so that waves propagating
          within the PML are attenuated sufficiently, but making `R_asymptotic` too small
          will increase the numerical reflection due to discretization.

        + **`pml_profile` [`function`]** — By default, Meep turns on the PML conductivity
          quadratically within the PML layer &mdash; one doesn't want to turn it on
          suddenly, because that exacerbates reflections due to the discretization. More
          generally, with `pml_profile` one can specify an arbitrary PML "profile"
          function $f(u)$ that determines the shape of the PML absorption profile up to an
          overall constant factor. *u* goes from 0 to 1 at the start and end of the PML,
          and the default is $f(u) = u^2$. In some cases where a very thick PML is
          required, such as in a periodic medium (where there is technically no such thing
          as a true PML, only a pseudo-PML), it can be advantageous to turn on the PML
          absorption more smoothly. See [Optics Express, Vol. 16, pp. 11376-92

class Absorber(PML):
    """
    Instead of a `PML` layer, there is an alternative class called `Absorber` which is a
    **drop-in** replacement for `PML`. For example, you can do
    `boundary_layers=[mp.Absorber(thickness=2)]` instead of
    `boundary_layers=[mp.PML(thickness=2)]`. All the parameters are the same as for `PML`,
    above. You can have a mix of `PML` on some boundaries and `Absorber` on others.

    The `Absorber` class does *not* implement a perfectly matched layer (PML), however
    (except in 1d). Instead, it is simply a scalar electric **and** magnetic conductivity
    that turns on gradually within the layer according to the `pml_profile` (defaulting to
    quadratic). Such a scalar conductivity gradient is only reflectionless in the limit as
    the layer becomes sufficiently thick.

    The main reason to use `Absorber` is if you have **a case in which PML fails:**

    -   No true PML exists for *periodic* media, and a scalar absorber is computationally
        less expensive and generally just as good. See [Optics Express, Vol. 16, pp.
        11376-92 (2008)](http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=oe-16-15-11376).
    -   PML can lead to *divergent* fields for certain waveguides with "backward-wave"
        modes; this can readily occur in metals with surface plasmons, and a scalar
        absorber is your only choice. See [Physical Review E, Vol. 79, 065601
        (2009)](http://math.mit.edu/~stevenj/papers/LohOs09.pdf).
    -   PML can fail if you have a waveguide hitting the edge of your cell *at an angle*.

class DftObj:
    """Wrapper around DFT objects that allows delayed initialization of the structure.

    When splitting the structure into chunks for parallel simulations, we want to know all
    of the details of the simulation in order to ensure that each processor gets a similar
    amount of work. The problem with DFTs is that the `add_flux` style methods immediately
    initialize the structure and fields. So, if the user adds multiple DFT objects to the
    simulation, the load balancing code only knows about the first one and can't split the
    work up nicely. To circumvent this, we delay the execution of the `add_flux` methods
    as late as possible. When `add_flux` (or `add_near2far`, etc.) is called, we:

    1. Create an instance of the appropriate subclass of `DftObj` (`DftForce`, `DftFlux`, etc.).
       Set its args property to the list of arguments passed to `add_flux`, and set its func
       property to the 'real' `add_flux`, which is prefixed by an underscore.

    2. Add this `DftObj` to the list Simulation.dft_objects. When we actually run the
       simulation, we call `Simulation._evaluate_dft_objects`, which calls `dft.func(*args)`
       for each dft in the list.

    If the user tries to access a property or call a function on the `DftObj` before
    `Simulation._evaluate_dft_objects` is called, then we initialize the C++ object through
    swigobj_attr and return the property they requested.

    Harminv is implemented as a class with a [`__call__`](#Harminv.__call__) method,
    which allows it to be used as a step function that collects field data from a given
    point and runs [Harminv](https://github.com/NanoComp/harminv) on that data to extract
    the frequencies, decay rates, and other information.

    See [`__init__`](#Harminv.__init__) for details about constructing a `Harminv`.

    **Important:** normally, you should only use Harminv to analyze data *after the
    sources are off*. Wrapping it in `after_sources(mp.Harminv(...))` is sufficient.

    In particular, Harminv takes the time series $f(t)$ corresponding to the given field
    component as a function of time and decomposes it (within the specified bandwidth) as:

    $$f(t) = \\sum_n a_n e^{-i\\omega_n t}$$

    The results are stored in the list `Harminv.modes`, which is a list of tuples holding
    the frequency, amplitude, and error of the modes. Given one of these tuples (e.g.,
    `first_mode = harminv_instance.modes[0]`), you can extract its various components:

    + **`freq`** — The real part of frequency ω (in the usual Meep 2πc units).

    + **`decay`** — The imaginary part of the frequency ω.

    + **`Q`** — The dimensionless lifetime, or quality factor defined as
      $-\\mathrm{Re}\\,\\omega / 2 \\mathrm{Im}\\,\\omega$.

    + **`amp`** — The complex amplitude $a$.

    + **`err`** — A crude measure of the error in the frequency (both real and imaginary).
      If the error is much larger than the imaginary part, for example, then you can't
      trust the $Q$ to be accurate. Note: this error is only the uncertainty in the signal
      processing, and tells you nothing about the errors from finite resolution, finite
      cell size, and so on.

    For example, `[m.freq for m in harminv_instance.modes]` gives a list of the real parts
    of the frequencies. Be sure to save a reference to the `Harminv` instance if you wish
    to use the results after the simulation:

    ```py
    sim = mp.Simulation(...)
    h = mp.Harminv(...)
    sim.run(mp.after_sources(h))
    # do something with h.modes

        datatypes like `GeometricObject`, are described in a later subsection. The basic
        datatypes, like `integer`, `boolean`, `complex`, and `string` are defined by
        Python. `Vector3` is a `meep` class.

        + **`geometry` [ list of `GeometricObject` class ]** — Specifies the geometric
          objects making up the structure being simulated. When objects overlap, later
          objects in the list take precedence. Defaults to no objects (empty list).

        + **`geometry_center` [ `Vector3` class ]** — Specifies the coordinates of the
          center of the cell. Defaults to (0, 0, 0), but changing this allows you to shift
          the coordinate system used in Meep (for example, to put the origin at the
          corner).  Passing `geometry_center=c` is equivalent to adding the `c` vector to
          the coordinates of every other object in the simulation, i.e. `c` becomes the
          new origin that other objects are defined with respect to.

        + **`sources` [ list of `Source` class ]** — Specifies the current sources to be
          present in the simulation. Defaults to none (empty list).

        + **`symmetries` [ list of `Symmetry` class ]** — Specifies the spatial symmetries
          (mirror or rotation) to exploit in the simulation. Defaults to none (empty
          list). The symmetries must be obeyed by *both* the structure and the sources.
          See also [Exploiting Symmetry](Exploiting_Symmetry.md).

        + **`boundary_layers` [ list of `PML` class ]** — Specifies the
          [PML](Perfectly_Matched_Layer.md) absorbing boundary layers to use. Defaults to
          none (empty list).

        + **`cell_size` [ `Vector3` ]** — Specifies the size of the cell which is centered
          on the origin of the coordinate system. Any sizes of 0 imply a
          reduced-dimensionality calculation. Strictly speaking, the dielectric function
          is taken to be uniform along that dimension. A 2d calculation is especially
          optimized. See `dimensions` below. **Note:** because Maxwell's equations are
          scale invariant, you can use any units of distance you want to specify the cell
          size: nanometers, microns, centimeters, etc. However, it is usually convenient
          to pick some characteristic lengthscale of your problem and set that length to 1.
          See also [Units](Introduction.md#units-in-meep). Required argument (no default).

        + **`default_material` [`Medium` class ]** — Holds the default material that is
          used for points not in any object of the geometry list. Defaults to `air` (ε=1).
          This can also be a NumPy array that defines a dielectric function much like
          `epsilon_input_file` below (see below). If you want to use a material function
          as the default material, use the `material_function` keyword argument (below).

        + **`material_function` [ function ]** — A Python function that takes a `Vector3`
          and returns a `Medium`. See also [Material Function](#medium).
          Defaults to `None`.

        + **`epsilon_func` [ function ]** — A Python function that takes a `Vector3` and
          returns the dielectric constant at that point. See also [Material
          Function](#medium). Defaults to `None`.

        + **`epsilon_input_file` [`string`]** — If this string is not empty (the default),
          then it should be the name of an HDF5 file whose first/only dataset defines a
          scalar, real-valued, frequency-independent dielectric function over some
          discrete grid. Alternatively, the dataset name can be specified explicitly if
          the string is in the form "filename:dataset". This dielectric function is then
          used in place of the ε property of `default_material` (i.e. where there are no
          `geometry` objects). The grid of the epsilon file dataset need *not* match the
          computational grid; it is scaled and/or linearly interpolated as needed to map
          the file onto the cell. The structure is warped if the proportions of the grids
          do not match. **Note:** the file contents only override the ε property of the
          `default_material`, whereas other properties (μ, susceptibilities,
          nonlinearities, etc.) of `default_material` are still used.

        + **`dimensions` [`integer`]** — Explicitly specifies the dimensionality of the
          simulation, if the value is less than 3. If the value is 3 (the default), then
          the dimensions are automatically reduced to 2 if possible when `cell_size` in
          the $z$ direction is `0`. If `dimensions` is the special value of `CYLINDRICAL`,
          then cylindrical coordinates are used and the $x$ and $z$ dimensions are
          interpreted as $r$ and $z$, respectively. If `dimensions` is 1, then the cell
          must be along the $z$ direction and only $E_x$ and $H_y$ field components are
          permitted. If `dimensions` is 2, then the cell must be in the $xy$ plane.

        + **`m` [`number`]** — For `CYLINDRICAL` simulations, specifies that the angular
          $\\phi$ dependence of the fields is of the form $e^{im\\phi}$ (default is `m=0`).
          If the simulation cell includes the origin $r=0$, then `m` must be an integer.

        + **`accurate_fields_near_cylorigin` [`boolean`]** — For `CYLINDRICAL` simulations
          with |*m*| &gt; 1, compute more accurate fields near the origin $r=0$ at the
          expense of requiring a smaller Courant factor. Empirically, when this option is
          set to `True`, a Courant factor of roughly $\\min[0.5, 1 / (|m| + 0.5)]$ or
          smaller seems to be needed. Default is `False`, in which case the $D_r$, $D_z$,
          and $B_r$ fields within |*m*| pixels of the origin are forced to zero, which
          usually ensures stability with the default Courant factor of 0.5, at the expense
          of slowing convergence of the fields near $r=0$.

        + **`resolution` [`number`]** — Specifies the computational grid resolution in
          pixels per distance unit. Required argument. No default.

        + **`k_point` [`False` or `Vector3`]** — If `False` (the default), then the
          boundaries are perfect metallic (zero electric field). If a `Vector3`, then the
          boundaries are Bloch-periodic: the fields at one side are
          $\\exp(i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{R})$ times the fields at the other side, separated
          by the lattice vector $\\mathbf{R}$. A non-zero `Vector3` will produce complex
          fields. The `k_point` vector is specified in Cartesian coordinates in units of
          2π/distance. Note: this is *different* from [MPB](https://mpb.readthedocs.io),
          equivalent to taking MPB's `k_points` through its function
          `reciprocal->cartesian`.

        + **`kz_2d` [`"complex"`, `"real/imag"`, or `"3d"`]** — A 2d cell (i.e.,
          `dimensions=2`) combined with a `k_point` that has a *non-zero* component in $z$
          would normally result in a 3d simulation with complex fields. However, by
          default (`kz_2d="complex"`), Meep will use a 2d computational cell in which
          $k_z$ is incorporated as an additional term in Maxwell's equations, which still
          results in complex fields but greatly improved performance. Setting `kz_2d="3d"`
          will instead use a 3d cell that is one pixel thick (with Bloch-periodic boundary
          conditions), which is considerably more expensive. The third possibility,
          `kz_2d="real/imag"`, saves an additional factor of two by storing some field
          components as purely real and some as purely imaginary in a "real" field, but
          this option requires some care to use. See [2d Cell with Out-of-Plane
          Wavevector](2d_Cell_Special_kz.md).

        + **`ensure_periodicity` [`boolean`]** — If `True` (the default) *and* if the
          boundary conditions are periodic (`k_point` is not `False`), then the geometric
          objects are automatically repeated periodically according to the lattice vectors
          which define the size of the cell.

        + **`eps_averaging` [`boolean`]** — If `True` (the default), then [subpixel
          averaging](Subpixel_Smoothing.md) is used when initializing the dielectric
          function. For simulations involving a [material function](#medium),
          `eps_averaging` is `False` (the default) and must be
          [enabled](Subpixel_Smoothing.md#enabling-averaging-for-material-function) in
          which case the input variables `subpixel_maxeval` (default 10<sup>4</sup>) and
          `subpixel_tol` (default 10<sup>-4</sup>) specify the maximum number of function
          evaluations and the integration tolerance for the adaptive numerical
          integration. Increasing/decreasing these, respectively, will cause a more
          accurate but slower computation of the average ε with diminishing returns for
          the actual FDTD error. Disabling subpixel averaging will lead to [staircasing
          effects and irregular
          convergence](Subpixel_Smoothing.md#what-happens-when-subpixel-smoothing-is-disabled).

        + **`force_complex_fields` [`boolean`]** — By default, Meep runs its simulations
          with purely real fields whenever possible. It uses complex fields which require
          twice the memory and computation if the `k_point` is non-zero or if `m` is
          non-zero. However, by setting `force_complex_fields` to `True`, Meep will always
          use complex fields.

        + **`force_all_components` [`boolean`]** — By default, in a 2d simulation Meep
          uses only the field components that might excited by your current sources:
          either the in-plane $(E_x,E_y,H_z)$ or out-of-plane $(H_x,H_y,E_z)$ polarization,
          depending on the source.  (Both polarizations are excited if you use multiple source
          polarizations, or if an anisotropic medium is present that couples the two
          polarizations.)   In rare cases (primarily for combining results of multiple
          simulations with differing polarizations), you might want to force it to
          simulate all fields, even those that remain zero throughout the simulation, by
          setting `force_all_components` to `True`.

        + **`filename_prefix` [`string`]** — A string prepended to all output filenames
          (e.g., for HDF5 files). If `None` (the default), then Meep constructs a default
          prefix based on the current Python filename ".py" replaced by "-" (e.g. `foo.py`
          uses a `"foo-"` prefix). You can get this prefix by calling `get_filename_prefix`.

        + **`Courant` [`number`]** — Specify the
          [Courant factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courant%E2%80%93Friedrichs%E2%80%93Lewy_condition)
          $S$ which relates the time step size to the spatial discretization: $cΔ t = SΔ x$.
          Default is 0.5. For numerical stability, the Courant factor must be *at
          most* $n_\\textrm{min}/\\sqrt{\\textrm{# dimensions}}$, where $n_\\textrm{min}$ is
          the minimum refractive index (usually 1), and in practice $S$ should be slightly
          smaller.

        + **`loop_tile_base_db`, `loop_tile_base_eh` [`number`]** — To improve the [memory locality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality_of_reference)
          of the field updates, Meep has an experimental feature to "tile" the loops over the Yee grid
          voxels. The splitting of the update loops for step-curl and update-eh into tiles or subdomains
          involves a recursive-bisection method in which the base case for the number of voxels is
          specified using these two parameters, respectively. The default value is 0 or no tiling;
          a typical nonzero value to try would be 10000.

        + **`output_volume` [`Volume` class ]** — Specifies the default region of space
          that is output by the HDF5 output functions (below); see also the `Volume` class
          which manages `meep::volume*` objects. Default is `None`, which means that the
          whole cell is output. Normally, you should use the `in_volume(...)` function to
          modify the output volume instead of setting `output_volume` directly.

        + **`output_single_precision` [`boolean`]** — Meep performs its computations in
          [double-precision floating point](Build_From_Source.md#floating-point-precision-of-the-fields-and-materials-arrays),
          and by default its output HDF5 files are in the same format. However, by setting
          this variable to `True` (default is `False`) you can instead output in single
          precision which saves a factor of two in space.

        + **`progress_interval` [`number`]** — Time interval (seconds) after which Meep
          prints a progress message. Default is 4 seconds.

        + **`extra_materials` [ list of `Medium` class ]** — By default, Meep turns off
          support for material dispersion ([susceptibilities](#susceptibility) or
          [conductivity](Materials.md#conductivity-and-complex)) or nonlinearities if none
          of the objects in `geometry` have materials with these properties &mdash; since
          they are not needed, it is faster to omit their calculation. This doesn't work,
          however, if you use a `material_function`: materials via a user-specified
          function of position instead of just geometric objects. If your material
          function only returns a nonlinear material, for example, Meep won't notice this
          unless you tell it explicitly via `extra_materials`. `extra_materials` is a list
          of materials that Meep should look for in the cell in addition to any materials
          that are specified by geometric objects. You should list any materials other
          than scalar dielectrics that are returned by `material_function` here.

        + **`chunk_layout` [`string` or `Simulation` instance or `BinaryPartition` class]** —
          This will cause the `Simulation` to use the chunk layout described by either
          (1) an `.h5` file (created using `Simulation.dump_chunk_layout`), (2) another
          `Simulation` instance, or (3) a [`BinaryPartition`](#binarypartition) class object.
          For more information, see [Load and Dump Structure](#load-and-dump-structure) and
          [Parallel Meep/User-Specified Cell Partition](Parallel_Meep.md#user-specified-cell-partition).

        The following require a bit more understanding of the inner workings of Meep to
        use. See also [SWIG Wrappers](#swig-wrappers).

        + **`structure` [`meep::structure*`]** — Pointer to the current structure being
          simulated; initialized by `_init_structure` which is called automatically by
          `init_sim()` which is called automatically by any of the [run
          functions](#run-functions). The structure initialization is handled by the
          `Simulation` class, and most users will not need to call `_init_structure`.

        + **`fields` [`meep::fields*`]** — Pointer to the current fields being simulated;
          initialized by `init_sim()` which is called automatically by any of the [run
          functions](#run-functions).

        + **`num_chunks` [`integer`]** — Minimum number of "chunks" (subregions) to divide
          the structure/fields into. Overrides the default value determined by
          the number of processors, PML layers, etcetera. Mainly useful for debugging.

        + **`split_chunks_evenly` [`boolean`]** — When `True` (the default), the work per
          [chunk](Chunks_and_Symmetry.md) is not taken into account when splitting chunks
          up for multiple processors. The cell is simply split up into equal chunks (with
          the exception of PML regions, which must be on their own chunk). When `False`,
          Meep attempts to allocate an equal amount of work to each processor, which can
          increase the performance of [parallel simulations](Parallel_Meep.md).

        Takes as input a subregion of the cell and the field/material component. The
        method returns a NumPy array containing values of the field/material at the
        current simulation time.

        **Parameters:**

        + `vol`: `Volume`; the orthogonal subregion/slice of the computational volume. The
          return value of `get_array` has the same dimensions as the `Volume`'s `size`
          attribute. If `None` (default), then a `size` and `center` must be specified.

        + `center`, `size` : `Vector3`; if both are specified, the library will construct
          an appropriate `Volume`. This is a convenience feature and alternative to
          supplying a `Volume`.

        + `component`: field/material component (i.e., `mp.Ex`, `mp.Hy`, `mp.Sz`,
          `mp.Dielectric`, etc). Defaults to `None`.

        + `cmplx`: `boolean`; if `True`, return complex-valued data otherwise return
          real-valued data (default).

        + `arr`: optional parameter to pass a pre-allocated NumPy array of the correct size and
          type (either `numpy.float32` or `numpy.float64` depending on the [floating-point precision
          of the fields and materials](Build_From_Source.md#floating-point-precision-of-the-fields-and-materials-arrays))
          which will be overwritten with the field/material data instead of allocating a
          new array.  Normally, this will be the array returned from a previous call to
          `get_array` for a similar slice, allowing one to re-use `arr` (e.g., when
          fetching the same slice repeatedly at different times).

        + `frequency`: optional frequency point over which the average eigenvalue of the
          $\\varepsilon$ and $\\mu$ tensors are evaluated. Defaults to 0 which is the
          instantaneous $\\varepsilon$.

        + `snap`: By default, the elements of the grid slice are obtained using a bilinear
          interpolation of the nearest Yee grid points. Empty dimensions of the grid slice
          are "collapsed" into a single element. However, if `snap` is set to `True`, this
          interpolation behavior is disabled and the grid slice is instead "snapped"
          everywhere to the nearest grid point. (Empty slice dimensions are still of size
          one.) This feature is mainly useful for comparing results with the
          [`output_` routines](#output-functions) (e.g., `output_epsilon`, `output_efield_z`, etc.).

        For convenience, the following wrappers for `get_array` over the entire cell are
        available: `get_epsilon()`, `get_mu()`, `get_hpwr()`, `get_dpwr()`,
        `get_tot_pwr()`, `get_Xfield()`, `get_Xfield_x()`, `get_Xfield_y()`,
        `get_Xfield_z()`, `get_Xfield_r()`, `get_Xfield_p()` where `X` is one of `h`, `b`,
        `e`, `d`, or `s`. The routines `get_Xfield_*` all return an array type consistent
        with the fields (real or complex). The routines `get_epsilon()` and `get_mu()`
        accept the optional argument `frequency` (defaults to 0) and all routines accept
        `snap` (defaults to `False`).

        **Note on array-slice dimensions:** The routines `get_epsilon`, `get_Xfield_z`,
        etc. use as default `size=meep.Simulation.fields.total_volume()` which for
        simulations involving Bloch-periodic boundaries (via `k_point`) will result in
        arrays that have slightly *different* dimensions than e.g.
        `get_array(center=meep.Vector3(), size=cell_size, component=meep.Dielectric`, etc.
        (i.e., the slice spans the entire cell volume `cell_size`). Neither of these
        approaches is "wrong", they are just slightly different methods of fetching the
        boundaries. The key point is that if you pass the same value for the `size`
        parameter, or use the default, the slicing routines always give you the same-size
        array for all components. You should *not* try to predict the exact size of these
        arrays; rather, you should simply rely on Meep's output.

        sim.reset_meep()
        ...set up and run second simulation...

        It is also possible to timestep both fields simultaneously (e.g. doing one
        timestep of one simulation then one timestep of another simulation, and so on, but
        this requires you to call much lower-level functions like `fields_step()`.

        trapezoidal rule, and the maximum is similarly over the grid points. See [Field

        Plots a 2D cross section of the simulation domain using `matplotlib`. The plot
        includes the geometry, boundary layers, sources, and monitors. Fields can also be
        superimposed on a 2D slice. Requires [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org). Calling
        this function would look something like:

        ```py
        sim = mp.Simulation(...)
        sim.run(...)
        field_func = lambda x: 20*np.log10(np.abs(x))
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        sim.plot2D(fields=mp.Ez,
                   field_parameters={'alpha':0.8, 'cmap':'RdBu', 'interpolation':'none', 'post_process':field_func},
                   boundary_parameters={'hatch':'o', 'linewidth':1.5, 'facecolor':'y', 'edgecolor':'b', 'alpha':0.3})
        plt.show()
        plt.savefig('sim_domain.png')
        ```
        If you just want to quickly visualize the simulation domain without the fields (i.e., when
        setting up your simulation), there is no need to invoke the `run` function prior to calling
        `plot2D`. Just define the `Simulation` object followed by any DFT monitors and then
        invoke `plot2D`.

        Note: When running a [parallel simulation](Parallel_Meep.md), the `plot2D` function expects
        to be called on all processes, but only generates a plot on the master process.

        **Parameters:**

        * `ax`: a `matplotlib` axis object. `plot2D()` will add plot objects, like lines,
          patches, and scatter plots, to this object. If no `ax` is supplied, then the
          routine will create a new figure and grab its axis.
        * `output_plane`: a `Volume` object that specifies the plane over which to plot.
          Must be 2D and a subset of the grid volume (i.e., it should not extend beyond
          the cell).
        * `fields`: the field component (`mp.Ex`, `mp.Ey`, `mp.Ez`, `mp.Hx`, `mp.Hy`,
          `mp.Hz`) to superimpose over the simulation geometry. Default is `None`, where
          no fields are superimposed.
        * `labels`: if `True`, then labels will appear over each of the simulation
          elements.
        * `eps_parameters`: a `dict` of optional plotting parameters that override the
          default parameters for the geometry.
            - `interpolation='spline36'`: interpolation algorithm used to upsample the pixels.
            - `cmap='binary'`: the color map of the geometry
            - `alpha=1.0`: transparency of geometry
            - `contour=False`: if `True`, plot a contour of the geometry rather than its image
            - `contour_linewidth=1`: line width of the contour lines if `contour=True`
            - `frequency=None`: for materials with a [frequency-dependent
              permittivity](Materials.md#material-dispersion) $\\varepsilon(f)$, specifies the
              frequency $f$ (in Meep units) of the real part of the permittivity to use in the
              plot. Defaults to the `frequency` parameter of the [Source](#source) object.
            - `resolution=None`: the resolution of the $\\varepsilon$ grid. Defaults to the
              `resolution` of the `Simulation` object.
            - `colorbar=False`: whether to add a colorbar to the plot's parent Figure based on epsilon values.
        * `boundary_parameters`: a `dict` of optional plotting parameters that override
          the default parameters for the boundary layers.
            - `alpha=1.0`: transparency of boundary layers
            - `facecolor='g'`: color of polygon face
            - `edgecolor='g'`: color of outline stroke
            - `linewidth=1`: line width of outline stroke
            - `hatch='\\'`: hatching pattern
        * `source_parameters`: a `dict` of optional plotting parameters that override the
          default parameters for the sources.
            - `color='r'`: color of line and pt sources
            - `alpha=1.0`: transparency of source
            - `facecolor='none'`: color of polygon face for planar sources
            - `edgecolor='r'`: color of outline stroke for planar sources
            - `linewidth=1`: line width of outline stroke
            - `hatch='\\'`: hatching pattern
            - `label_color='r'`: color of source labels
            - `label_alpha=0.3`: transparency of source label box
            - `offset=20`: distance from source center and label box
        * `monitor_parameters`: a `dict` of optional plotting parameters that override the
          default parameters for the monitors.
            - `color='g'`: color of line and point monitors
            - `alpha=1.0`: transparency of monitors
            - `facecolor='none'`: color of polygon face for planar monitors
            - `edgecolor='r'`: color of outline stroke for planar monitors
            - `linewidth=1`: line width of outline stroke
            - `hatch='\\'`: hatching pattern
            - `label_color='g'`: color of source labels
            - `label_alpha=0.3`: transparency of monitor label box
            - `offset=20`: distance from monitor center and label box
        * `field_parameters`: a `dict` of optional plotting parameters that override the
          default parameters for the fields.
            - `interpolation='spline36'`: interpolation function used to upsample field pixels
            - `cmap='RdBu'`: color map for field pixels
            - `alpha=0.6`: transparency of fields
            - `post_process=np.real`: post processing function to apply to fields (must be
              a function object)
            - `colorbar=False`: whether to add a colorbar to the plot's parent Figure based on field values.
        * `colorbar_parameters`:  a `dict` of optional plotting parameters that override the default parameters for
          the colorbar.
            - `label=None`: an optional label for the colorbar, defaults to '$\\epsilon_r$' for epsilon and
            'field values' for fields.
            - `orientation='vertical'`: the orientation of the colorbar gradient
            - `extend=None`: make pointed end(s) for out-of-range values. Allowed values are:
            ['neither', 'both', 'min', 'max']
            - `format=None`: formatter for tick labels. Can be an fstring (i.e. "{x:.2e}") or a
            [matplotlib.ticker.ScalarFormatter](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/ticker_api.html#matplotlib.ticker.ScalarFormatter).
            - `position='right'`: position of the colorbar with respect to the Axes
            - `size='5%'`: size of the colorbar in the dimension perpendicular to its `orientation`
            - `pad='2%'`: fraction of original axes between colorbar and image axes
        * `nb`: set this to True if plotting in a Jupyter notebook to use ipympl for plotting. Note: this requires
        ipympl to be installed.

    the HDF5 file. The second argument is a string giving options to pass to h5topng (e.g.
    `"-Zc bluered"`). See also [Tutorial/Basics/Output Tips and
    Tricks](Python_Tutorials/Basics.md#output-tips-and-tricks).

    It is often useful to use the h5topng `-C` or `-A` options to overlay the dielectric
    function when outputting fields. To do this, you need to know the name of the
    dielectric-function `.h5` file which must have been previously output by
    `output_epsilon`. To make this easier, a built-in shell variable `$EPS` is provided
    which refers to the last-output dielectric-function `.h5` file. So, for example
    `output_png(mp.Ez,"-C $EPS")` will output the $E_z$ field and overlay the dielectric
    contours.

    By default, `output_png` deletes the `.h5` file when it is done. To preserve the `.h5`
    file requires `output_png(component, h5topng_options, rm_h5=False)`.
