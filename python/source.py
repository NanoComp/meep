    The `Source` class is used to specify the current sources via the `Simulation.sources`
    attribute. Note that all sources in Meep are separable in time and space, i.e. of the
    form $\\mathbf{J}(\\mathbf{x},t) = \\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{x}) \\cdot f(t)$ for some functions
    $\\mathbf{A}$ and $f$. Non-separable sources can be simulated, however, by modifying
    the sources after each time step. When real fields are being used (which is the
    default in many cases; see `Simulation.force_complex_fields`), only the real part of
    the current source is used.

    **Important note**: These are *current* sources (**J** terms in Maxwell's equations),
    even though they are labelled by electric/magnetic field components. They do *not*
    specify a particular electric/magnetic field which would be what is called a "hard"
    source in the FDTD literature. There is no fixed relationship between the current
    source and the resulting field amplitudes; it depends on the surrounding geometry, as
    described in the
    [FAQ](FAQ.md#how-does-the-current-amplitude-relate-to-the-resulting-field-amplitude)

          current component: e.g. `mp.Ex`, `mp.Ey`, etcetera for an electric-charge
          current, and `mp.Hx`, `mp.Hy`, etcetera for a magnetic-charge current. Note that

          the cell. No default.

        + **`size` [`Vector3`]** — The size of the current distribution along each
          direction of the cell. Default is `(0,0,0)`: a point-dipole source.

        + **`volume` [`Volume`]** — A `meep.Volume` can be used to specify the source
          region instead of a `center` and a `size`.

          current source. Default is 1.0.

        + **`amp_func` [`function`]** — A Python function of a single argument, that takes
          a `Vector3` giving a position and returns a complex current amplitude for that
          point. The position argument is *relative* to the `center` of the current
          source, so that you can move your current around without changing your function.
          Default is `None`, meaning that a constant amplitude of 1.0 is used. Note that
          your amplitude function (if any) is *multiplied* by the `amplitude` property, so
          both properties can be used simultaneously.

        + **`amp_func_file` [`string`]** — String of the form
          `path_to_h5_file.h5:dataset`. The `.h5` extension is optional. Meep will read
          the HDF5 file and create an amplitude function that interpolates into the grid
          specified by the file. Meep expects the data to be split into real and imaginary
          parts, so in the above example it will look for `dataset.re` and `dataset.im` in
          the file `path_to_h5_file.h5`. Defaults to the empty string.

        + **`amp_data` [`numpy.ndarray with dtype=numpy.complex128`]** — Like
          `amp_func_file` above, but instead of interpolating into an HDF5 file,
          interpolates into a complex NumPy array. The array should be three dimensions.
          For a 2d simulation, just pass 1 for the third dimension, e.g., `arr =
          np.zeros((N, M, 1), dtype=np.complex128)`. Defaults to `None`.

        a single waveguide mode (or other mode of some cross section or periodic region)
        at a single frequency, and which couples primarily into that mode as long as the
        bandwidth is not too broad. This is possible if you have
        [MPB](https://mpb.readthedocs.io) installed: Meep will call MPB to compute the
        field profile of the desired mode, and uses the field profile to produce an
        equivalent current source. Note: this feature does *not* work in cylindrical

    This is a subclass of `Source` and has **all of the properties** of `Source` above.
    However, you normally do not specify a `component`. Instead of `component`, the

    the modes, $\\mathbf{u}_{n,\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{r}) e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}}$,
    of the dielectric profile in the region given by the `size` and `center` of the
    source, with the modes computed as if the *source region were repeated periodically in
    all directions*. If an `amplitude` and/or `amp_func` are supplied, they are
    *multiplied* by this current profile. The desired eigenmode and other features are
    specified by the properties shown in `__init__`.

    Eigenmode sources are normalized so that in the case of a time-harmonic simulation
    with all sources and fields having monochromatic time dependence $e^{-i 2\\pi f_m t}$
    where $f_m$ is the frequency of the eigenmode, the total time-average power of the
    fields — the integral of the normal Poynting vector over the entire cross-sectional
    line or plane — is equal to 1. This convention has two use cases:

    + For [frequency-domain
      calculations](Python_User_Interface.md#frequency-domain-solver) involving a
      `ContinuousSource` time dependence, the time-average power of the fields is 1.

    + For time-domain calculations involving a time dependence $W(t)$ which is typically a
      [Gaussian](#gaussiansource), the amplitude of the fields at frequency $f$ will be
      multiplied by $\\widetilde W(f)$, the Fourier transform of $W(t)$, while
      field-bilinear quantities like the [Poynting flux](#flux-spectra) and [energy
      density](#energy-density-spectra) are multiplied by $|\\widetilde W(f)|^2$. For the
      particular case of a Gaussian time dependence, the Fourier transform at $f$ can be
      obtained via the `fourier_transform` class method.

    In either case, the `eig_power` method returns the total power at frequency `f`.
    However, for a user-defined [`CustomSource`](#customsource), `eig_power` will *not*
    include the $|\\widetilde W(f)|^2$ factor since Meep does not know the Fourier
    transform of your source function $W(t)$. You will have to multiply by this yourself
    if you need it.

    **Note:** Due to discretization effects, the normalization of eigenmode sources to
    yield unit power transmission is only approximate: at any finite resolution, the power
    of the fields as measured using [DFT flux](#flux-spectra) monitors will not precisely
    match that of calling `eig_power` but will rather include discretization errors that
    decrease with resolution.  Generally, the most reliable procedure is to normalize your
    calculations by the power computed in a separate normalization run at the same
    resolution, as shown in several of the tutorial examples.

    Note that Meep's MPB interface only supports dispersionless non-magnetic materials but
    it does support anisotropic ε. Any nonlinearities, magnetic responses μ,
    conductivities σ, or dispersive polarizations in your materials will be *ignored* when
    computing the eigenmode source. PML will also be ignored.

          region are zero.  However, if the source region spans the *entire* cell in some
          directions, and the cell has Bloch-periodic boundary conditions via the
          `k_point` parameter, then the mode's **k** components in those directions will
          match `k_point` so that the mode satisfies the Meep boundary conditions,
          regardless of `eig_kpoint`. Note that once **k** is either found by MPB, or
          specified by `eig_kpoint`, the field profile used to create the current sources
          corresponds to the [Bloch mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_wave),
          $\\mathbf{u}_{n,\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{r})$, multiplied by the appropriate
          exponential factor, $e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}}$.

        + **`eig_parity` [`mp.NO_PARITY` (default), `mp.EVEN_Z`, `mp.ODD_Z`, `mp.EVEN_Y`,
          `mp.ODD_Y`]** — The parity (= polarization in 2d) of the mode to calculate,
          assuming the structure has $z$ and/or $y$ mirror symmetry *in the source
          region*, with respect to the `center` of the source region.  (In particular, it
          does not matter if your simulation as a whole has that symmetry, only the cross
          section where you are introducing the source.) If the structure has both $y$ and
          $z$ mirror symmetry, you can combine more than one of these, e.g. `EVEN_Z + ODD_Y`.
          Default is `NO_PARITY`, in which case MPB computes all of the bands
          which will still be even or odd if the structure has mirror symmetry, of course.
          This is especially useful in 2d simulations to restrict yourself to a desired
          polarization.

        + **`eig_resolution` [`integer`, defaults to `2*resolution` ]** — The spatial
          resolution to use in MPB for the eigenmode calculations. This defaults to twice
          the Meep `resolution` in which case the structure is linearly interpolated from
          the Meep pixels.

        + **`eig_tolerance` [`number`, defaults to 10<sup>–7</sup> ]** — The tolerance to
          use in the MPB eigensolver. MPB terminates when the eigenvalues stop changing to
          less than this fractional tolerance.

        + **`component` [as above, but defaults to `ALL_COMPONENTS`]** — Once the MPB
          modes are computed, equivalent electric and magnetic sources are created within
          Meep. By default, these sources include magnetic and electric currents in *all*
          transverse directions within the source region, corresponding to the mode fields
          as described in Section 4.2 ("Incident Fields and Equivalent Currents") in
          [Chapter 4](http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1301.5366) ("Electromagnetic Wave Source
          Conditions") of the book [Advances in FDTD Computational Electrodynamics:
          Photonics and Nanotechnology](https://www.amazon.com/Advances-FDTD-Computational-Electrodynamics-Nanotechnology/dp/1608071707).
          If you specify a `component` property, however, you can include only one
          component of these currents if you wish. Most users won't need this feature.

        + **`eig_lattice_size` [`Vector3`], `eig_lattice_center` [`Vector3`]** — Normally,
          the MPB computational unit cell is the same as the source volume given by the
          `size` and `center` parameters. However, occasionally you want the unit cell to
          be larger than the source volume. For example, to create an eigenmode source in
          a periodic medium, you need to pass MPB the entire unit cell of the periodic
          medium, but once the mode is computed then the actual current sources need only
          lie on a cross section of that medium. To accomplish this, you can specify the
          optional `eig_lattice_size` and `eig_lattice_center`, which define a volume
          (which must enclose `size` and `center`) that is used for the unit cell in MPB
          with the dielectric function ε taken from the corresponding region in the Meep
          simulation.

    This is a subclass of `Source` and has **all of the properties** of `Source` above. However, the `component` parameter of the `Source` object is ignored. The [Gaussian beam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_beam) is a transverse electromagnetic mode for which the source region must be a *line* (in 2d) or *plane* (in 3d). For a beam polarized in the $x$ direction with propagation along $+z$, the electric field is defined by $\\mathbf{E}(r,z)=E_0\\hat{x}\\frac{w_0}{w(z)}\\exp\\left(\\frac{-r^2}{w(z)^2}\\right)\\exp\\left(-i\\left(kz + k\\frac{r^2}{2R(z)}\\right)\\right)$ where $r$ is the radial distance from the center axis of the beam, $z$ is the axial distance from the beam's focus (or "waist"), $k=2\\pi n/\\lambda$ is the wavenumber (for a free-space wavelength $\\lambda$ and refractive index $n$ of the homogeneous, lossless medium in which the beam propagates), $E_0$ is the electric field amplitude at the origin, $w(z)$ is the radius at which the field amplitude decays by $1/e$ of its axial values, $w_0$ is the beam waist radius, and $R(z)$ is the radius of curvature of the beam's wavefront at $z$. The only independent parameters that need to be specified are $w_0$, $E_0$, $k$, and the location of the beam focus (i.e., the origin: $r=z=0$).

    (In 3d, we use a ["complex point-source" method](https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSAA.16.001381) to define a source that generates an exact Gaussian-beam solution.  In 2d, we currently use the simple approximation of taking a cross-section of the 3d beam.  In both cases, the beam is most accurate near the source's center frequency.)

    The `SourceTime` object (`Source.src`), which specifies the time dependence of the source, should normally be a narrow-band `ContinuousSource` or `GaussianSource`.  (For a `CustomSource`, the beam frequency is determined by the source's `center_frequency` parameter.)
