Building with the automake-generated Makefile succeeds, but 
python can't seem to make head or tail of the resulting _meep.la
file.

Building with Makefile.manual yields something that successfully compiles,
but the resulting import into python doesn't work:

>>> import meep
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "meep.py", line 28, in <module>
    _meep = swig_import_helper()
  File "meep.py", line 24, in swig_import_helper
    _mod = imp.load_module('_meep', fp, pathname, description)
ImportError: ./_meep.so: undefined symbol: _ZN4meep17material_function15eff_chi1inv_rowENS_9componentEPdRKNS_6volumeEdi
