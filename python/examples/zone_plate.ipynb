    "# Focusing Properties of a Binary-Phase Zone Plate\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to compute a [near-to-far field transformation](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python_User_Interface/#near-to-far-field-spectra) in cylindrical coordinates. This is demonstrated in this example for a binary-phase [zone plate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_plate) which is a rotationally-symmetric diffractive lens used to focus a normally-incident planewave to a single spot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using [scalar theory](http://zoneplate.lbl.gov/theory), the radius of the $n$<sup>th</sup> zone can be computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "$$ r_n^2 = n\\lambda (f+\\frac{n\\lambda}{4})$$\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n$ is the zone index (1,2,3,...,$N$), $f$ is the focal length, and $\\lambda$ is the operating wavelength. The main design variable is the number of zones $N$. The design specifications of the zone plate are similar to the binary-phase grating in [Tutorial/Mode Decomposition/Diffraction Spectrum of a Binary Grating](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python_Tutorials/Mode_Decomposition/#diffraction-spectrum-of-a-binary-grating) with refractive index of 1.5 (glass), $\\lambda$ of 0.5 μm, and height of 0.5 μm. The focusing property of the zone plate is verified by the concentration of the electric-field energy density at the focal length of 0.2 mm (which lies *outside* the cell). The planewave is incident from within a glass substrate and spans the entire length of the cell in the radial direction. The cell is surrounded on all sides by PML. A schematic of the simulation geometry for a design with 25 zones and flat-surface termination is shown below. The near-field line monitor is positioned at the edge of the PML.\n",

    "Note that the volume specified in `get_farfields` via `center` and `size` is in cylindrical coordinates. These points must therefore lie in the $\\phi = 0$ ($rz = xz$) plane. The fields $E$ and $H$ returned by `get_farfields` can be thought of as either cylindrical ($r$,$\\phi$,$z$) or Cartesian ($x$,$y$,$z$) coordinates since these are the same in the $\\phi = 0$ plane (i.e., $E_r=E_x$ and $E_\\phi=E_y$). Also, `get_farfields` tends to gradually *slow down* as the far-field point gets closer to the near-field monitor. This performance degradation is unavoidable and is due to the larger number of $\\phi$ integration points required for accurate convergence of the integral involving the Green's function which diverges as the evaluation point approaches the source point.\n",

    "Shown below is the far-field energy-density profile around the focal length for both the *r* and *z* coordinate directions for three lens designs with $N$ of 25, 50, and 100. The focus becomes sharper with increasing $N$ due to the enhanced constructive interference of the diffracted beam. As the number of zones $N$ increases, the size of the focal spot (full width at half maximum) at $z = 200$ μm decreases as $1/\\sqrt{N}$ (see eq. 17 of the [reference](http://zoneplate.lbl.gov/theory)). This means that doubling the resolution (halving the spot width) requires quadrupling the number of zones.\n",
