# Material dispersion example, from the Meep tutorial.  Here, we simply
# simulate homogenous space filled with a dispersive material, and compute
# its modes as a function of wavevector k.  Since omega/c = k/n, we can
# extract the dielectric function epsilon(omega) = (ck/omega)^2.

# We'll use a dispersive material with two polarization terms, just for
# illustration.  The first one is a strong resonance at omega=1.1,
# which leads to a polaritonic gap in the dispersion relation.  The second
# one is a weak resonance at omega=0.5, whose main effect is to add a
# small absorption loss around that frequency.
