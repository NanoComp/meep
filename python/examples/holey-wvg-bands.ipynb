    "# Band Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will build off of the `holey-wvg-cavity.ipynb` tutorial by considering a smaller, more abstract calculation that we really should have done first. In particular, we compute the band diagram of the infinite periodic waveguide by itself with no defects. This is very similar to the types of calculations that MPB performs, but with a different method that has its own strengths and weaknesses. By analyzing what solutions can propagate in the periodic structure, one gains fundamental insight into the aperiodic structures from `holey-wvg-cavity.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us briefly review the problem. In a periodic system of this sort, the eigen-solutions can be expressed in the form of Bloch modes: a periodic Bloch envelope multiplied by a planewave $exp[i(k⋅x−\\omega t)]$, where $k$ is the Bloch wavevector. We wish to find the bands $\\omega(k)$. In this case, there is only one direction of periodicity, so we only have one wavevector component $k_x$. Moreover, the solutions are periodic functions of this wavevector: for a unit-period structure, $k_x$ and $k_x+2\\pi$ are redundant. Also, $k_x$ and $−k_x$ are redundant by time-reversal symmetry, so we only need to look for solutions in the irreducible Brillouin zone from $k_x=0$ to $k_x=\\pi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving for these eigenmodes is very similar to solving for the resonant modes of a cavity. We put in a pulse and analyze the response via Harminv except that our computational cell and boundary conditions are different. In particular, our computational cell is simply the unit cell of the periodicity. The $\\epsilon$ function then obeys periodic boundary conditions, but the fields obey Bloch-periodic boundary conditions: the fields at the right side are $exp(ik_x⋅1)$ times the fields at the left side. For each $k_x$, we will do a separate computation to get the frequencies at that $k_x$.\n",

    "The gray shaded region is the light cone, $\\omega>ck_x$, which is the region corresponding to modes that are extended in the air surrounding the waveguide. Below the light cone, we see several discrete guided bands, which must have field patterns localized to the vicinity of the waveguide. The imaginary part of $\\omega$ for bands below the light cone is very small, due to either numerical error or the finite computational cell size. Some tiny portion of the guided mode overlaps the PML. Note the band gap between the first and second guided mode, from about 0.2 to 0.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the light cone, we also see several discrete bands. These are leaky modes, or resonances, which have some intrinsic lifetime/loss because they couple with radiating states inside the light cone, which is reflected in the imaginary parts of their $\\omega$. Twice the imaginary part of $\\omega$ is the energy loss rate per unit time; for a waveguide, it is more conventional to report loss per unit distance; to get this you would divide the loss per unit time by the group velocity $|d\\omega/dk_x| = |slope|$. Harminv only identifies leaky modes that have a substantial lifetime. The default threshold is a lifetime, or $Q$, of 50 periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing band diagrams, especially for leaky modes, with a time-domain program like Meep involves several subtleties. For example, the accuracy of Harminv will go down if we specify too large a `df` (too narrow a source), because the increased number of modes makes the signal-processing more ill-conditioned. Sometimes, Harminv will report a spurious mode, which will appear as an isolated dot on the plot. Second, we sometimes have to be careful with modes and especially the imaginary parts to make sure they aren't an artifact of the cell being too small, or the signal-processing error being too large (either because the run is too short or because the bandwidth being searched is too large). Third, currently Meep doesn't attempt to \"connect the dots\" for the bands — the frequencies are printed in increasing order, but since modes disappear when their losses become too large this means that a single band may be split across several columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, there seem to be some bands that run right along the edge of the light cone. These are not leaky modes, but are artifacts of the fact that PML boundaries do not absorb well for light that is travelling parallel to the boundary, corresponding to extended modes at the boundary of the light cone. Below, we will see that these modes are not localized to the waveguide."
