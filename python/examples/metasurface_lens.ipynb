    "This example demonstrates how to compute the far-field profile at the focal length of a metasurface lens. The lens design, which is also part of the tutorial, is based on a supercell of binary-grating unit cells. For a review of the binary-grating geometry as well as a demonstration of computing its phasemap, see [Tutorial/Mode Decomposition/Phase Map of a Subwavelength Binary Grating](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python_Tutorials/Mode_Decomposition/#phase-map-of-a-subwavelength-binary-grating). The far-field calculation of the lens contains two separate components: (1) compute the phasemap of the unit cell as a function of a single geometric parameter, the duty cycle, while keeping its height and periodicity fixed (1.8 and 0.3 μm), and (2) form the supercell lens by tuning the local phase of each of a variable number of unit cells according to the quadratic formula for planar wavefront focusing. The design wavelength is 0.5 μm and the focal length is 0.2 mm. The input source is an $E_z$-polarized planewave at normal incidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to the script is the function `grating` with three geometric input arguments (periodicity, height, and list of duty cycles) which performs the two main tasks: (1) for a unit cell, it computes the phase (as well as the transmittance) and then translates this value from the range of [-π,π] of Mode Decomposition to [-2π,0] in order to be consistent with the analytic formula for the local phase and (2) for a supercell, it computes the far-field intensity profile around the focal length of the lens."

    "The phasemap is shown above. The left figure shows the transmittance which is nearly unity for all values of the duty cycle; the Fresnel transmittance is 0.96 for the glass-air interface. This is expected since the periodicity is subwavelength. The right figure shows the phase. There is a subregion in the middle of the plot spanning the duty-cycle range of roughly 0.16 to 0.65 in which the phase varies continuously over the full range of -2π to 0. This structural regime is used to design the supercell lens.\n",

    "In the second part of the calculation, the far-field energy-density profile of three supercell lens designs, comprised of 201, 401, and 801 unit cells, are computed using the quadratic formula for the local phase. Initially, this involves fitting the unit-cell phase data to a finer duty-cycle grid in order to enhance the local-phase interpolation of the supercell. This is important since as the number of unit cells in the lens increases, the local phase via the duty cycle varies more gradually from unit cell to unit cell. However, if the duty cycle becomes too gradual (i.e., less than a tenth of the pixel dimensions), the `resolution` may also need to be increased in order to improve the accuracy of [subpixel smoothing](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Subpixel_Smoothing)."
