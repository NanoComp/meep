    "We can also use the complex mode coefficients to compute the phase (or impedance) of the diffraction orders. This can be used to generate a phase map of the binary grating as a function of its geometric parameters. Phase maps are important for the design of subwavelength phase shifters such as those used in a metasurface lens. When the period of the unit cell is subwavelength, the zeroth-diffraction order is the only propagating wave. In this demonstration, which is adapted from the [previous example](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python_Tutorials/Mode_Decomposition/#diffraction-spectrum-of-a-binary-grating), we compute the transmittance spectra and phase map of the zeroth-diffraction order (at 0°) for an E<sub>z</sub>-polarized planewave pulse spanning wavelengths of 0.4 to 0.6 μm which is normally incident on a binary grating with a periodicity of 0.35 μm and height of 0.6 μm. The duty cycle of the grating is varied from 0.1 to 0.9 in separate runs."

    "The phase of the zeroth-diffraction order is simply the angle of its complex mode coefficient. Note that it is generally only the relative phase (the phase difference) between different structures that is useful. The overall mode coefficient α is multiplied by a complex number given by the source amplitude, as well as an arbitrary (but deterministic) phase choice by the mode solver MPB (i.e., which maximizes the energy in the real part of the fields via [`ModeSolver.fix_field_phase`](https://mpb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python_User_Interface/#loading-and-manipulating-the-current-field)) — but as long as you keep the current source fixed as you vary the parameters of the structure, the relative phases are meaningful.\n",

    "The figure below shows the transmittance spectra (left) and phase map (right). The transmittance is nearly unity over most of the parameter space mainly because of the subwavelength dimensions of the grating. The phase variation spans the full range of -π to +π at each wavelength but varies weakly with the duty cycle due to the relatively low index of the glass grating. Higher-index materials such as [titanium dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium_dioxide#Thin_films) (TiO<sub>2</sub>) generally provide more control over the phase"
