    "# Differential/Radar Cross Section\n",
    "\n",
    "As an extension of the [Mie scattering example](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python_Tutorials/Basics/#mie-scattering-of-a-lossless-dielectric-sphere) which involved computing the *scattering* cross section ($\\sigma_{scat}$), we will compute the *differential* cross section ($\\sigma_{diff}$) which is proportional to the [radar cross section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_cross-section). Computing $\\sigma_{diff}$ in a given direction involves three steps: (1) solve for the [near fields](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python_User_Interface/#near-to-far-field-spectra) on a closed box surrounding the object, (2) from the near fields, compute the far fields at a single point a large distance away (i.e., $R$ ≫  object diameter), and (3) calculate the Poynting flux of the far fields in the outward direction: $F = \\hat{r}\\cdot\\Re[E^* \\times H]$. The differential cross section in that direction is $R^2F$ divided by the incident intensity. The radar cross section is simply $\\sigma_{diff}$ in the \"backwards\" direction (i.e., backscattering) multiplied by 4π.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scattering cross section can be obtained by integrating the differential cross section over all [spherical angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system):\n",

    "The script is similar to the previous Mie scattering example with the main difference being the replacement of the `add_flux` with `add_near2far` objects. Instead of a linearly-polarized planewave, the source is circularly-polarized so that $\\sigma_{diff}$ is invariant with the rotation angle $\\phi$ around the axis of the incident direction (i.e., $x$). This way, the far fields need only be sampled with the polar angle $\\theta$. A circularly-polarized planewave can be generated by overlapping two linearly-polarized planewaves ($E_y$ and $E_z$) which are 90° out of phase via specifying `amplitude=1j` for one of the two sources. Note, however, that there is no need to use complex fields (by specifying `force_complex_fields=True` in the `Simulation` object) which would double the floating-point memory consumption since only the real part of the source amplitude is used by default. The circularly-polarized source breaks the mirror symmetry which increases the size of the simulation. The size of the near-field monitor box surrounding the sphere is doubled so that it lies *entirely within* the homogeneous air region (a requirement of the `near2far` feature). After the near fields have been obtained for λ = 1 μm the far fields are computed for 100 points along a semi-circle with radius 10,000X that of the dielectric sphere. (Note: any such large radius would give the same $\\sigma_{scat}$ to within discretization error). Finally, the scattered cross section is computed by numerically integrating the expression from above using the radial Poynting flux values.\n",
