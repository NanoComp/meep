    "## Reflectance Spectrum of Air-Silica Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "We will compute the broadband [reflectance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflectance) spectrum at normal incidence for a planar interface of vacuum/air and [fused quartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_quartz). As a validation, we will compare the simulated result with the analytic reflectance computed using the [Fresnel equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_equations). This is similar to an example in [Tutorial/Basics/Angular Reflectance Spectrum of a Planar Interface](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python_Tutorials/Basics/#angular-reflectance-spectrum-of-a-planar-interface) which involved computing the broadband reflectance spectrum over a range of angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wavelength-dependent, lossless permittivity of fused quartz, measured experimentally at 20°C, can be approximated by the [Sellmeier equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sellmeier_equation):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\varepsilon(\\lambda) = 1 + \\frac{0.6961663\\lambda^2}{\\lambda^2-0.0684043^2} + \\frac{0.4079426\\lambda^2}{\\lambda^2-0.1162414^2} + \\frac{0.8974794\\lambda^2}{\\lambda^2-9.896161^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The wavelength λ is in units of microns. This equation is valid from 0.21 to 6.7 μm. The Sellmeier form for the permittivity of fused quartz can be imported into Meep as a [Lorentzian susceptibility](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Materials/#material-dispersion) via a slight reorganization to convert the wavelength dependence into frequency as described in [Materials](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Materials/#sellmeier-coefficients). This is implemented in the [materials library](https://github.com/NanoComp/meep/blob/master/python/materials.py#L153-L173).\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation involves a 1d cell. A planewave current source with a pulsed profile spanning visible wavelengths of 0.4 to 0.8 μm is normally incident on the fused quartz from air. The reflectance is computed using the convention of two separate runs: (1) an empty cell to obtain the incident power, and (2) with the fused quartz to obtain the reflected power. The details of this type of calculation are described in [Tutorial/Basics/Transmittance Spectrum of a Waveguide Bend](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python_Tutorials/Basics/#transmittance-spectrum-of-a-waveguide-bend). The grid resolution, and by direct extension the time resolution via the [Courant condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courant%E2%80%93Friedrichs%E2%80%93Lewy_condition), must be made sufficiently fine to obtain agreement with the analytic results and to ensure [numerical stability](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Materials/#numerical-stability). Coarse resolutions may lead to field instabilities."
