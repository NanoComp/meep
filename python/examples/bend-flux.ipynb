    "We have computed the field patterns for light propagating around a waveguide bend. While this can be visually informative, the results are not quantitatively satisfying. We'd like to know exactly how much power makes it around the bend (transmittance), how much is reflected (reflectance), and how much is radiated away (scattered loss). How can we do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic principles are described in Introduction. The computation involves keeping track of the fields and their Fourier transform in a certain region, and from this computing the flux of electromagnetic energy as a function of $\\omega$. Moreover, we'll get an entire spectrum of the transmittance in a single run, by Fourier-transforming the response to a short pulse. However, in order to normalize the transmitted flux by the incident power to obtain the transmittance, we'll have to do _two_ runs, one with and one without the bend (i.e., a straight waveguide)."

As described in Introduction, the flux is the integral of the Poynting vector over the specified `FluxRegion`. It only integrates one component of the Poynting vector and the `direction` property specifies which component. In this example, since the `FluxRegion` is a line, the `direction` is its normal by default which therefore does not need to be explicitly defined."

We do this by first saving the Fourier-transformed fields from the normalization run. And then, before we start the second run, we load these fields, negated. The latter subtracts the Fourier-transformed incident fields from the Fourier transforms of the scattered fields. Logically, we might subtract these after the run, but it turns out to be more convenient to subtract the incident fields first and then accumulate the Fourier transform. All of this is accomplished with two commands which use the raw simulation data: get_flux_data and load_minus_flux_data. We run the first simulation as follows:"

Moreover, the time required is a bit tricky to predict when you have complex structures, because there might be resonant phenomena that allow the source to bounce around for a long time. Therefore, it is convenient to specify the run time in a different way: instead of using a fixed time, we require that |Ez|2 at the end of the waveguide must have decayed by a given amount (1/1000) from its peak value.\n",

    "The stop_when_fields_decayed routine takes four arguments: dT, component, pt, and decay_by. What it does is, after the sources have turned off, it keeps running for an additional dT time units every time the given |component|2 at the given point has not decayed by at least decay_by from its peak value for all times within the previous dT. In this case, dT=50, the component is Ez, the point is at the center of the flux plane at the end of the waveguide, and decay_by=0.001. So, it keeps running for an additional 50 time units until the square amplitude has decayed by 1/1000 from its peak.
