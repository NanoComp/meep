    "# Meep Adjoint Solver - Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial serves as a basic introduction to MEEP's adjoint solver. The adjoint solver provides a simple and flexible interface to calculating \"sensitivities\" or gradients of user specified objective functions with respect to **any number** of design variables -- **all with the cost of just two simulations.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical electromagnetic design problems are often constrained by complicated design requirements that aren't easily satisfied with physical intuition. We often formulate our problem as functions of Fourier transformed fields, (e.g. S-parameters, Poynting Fluxes, mode overlap coefficients, etc.). We can \"inverse design\" a structure that maximizes (or minimizes) this cost function with various optimization algorithms. The adjoint method provides an extremely cheap gradient, accelerating many out of the box optimization algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll demonstrate how you can quickly begin leveraging this interface. As a toy example, we'll examine a 2D integrated photonic waveguide bend. We'll code up a cost function that will tell our optimizer to maximize power transport around the bend. We'll discretize the bend into several individual pixels and calculate the gradient of this cost function w.r.t. all these pixels. Finally, we'll compare our gradients with finite difference approximates, which are much more expensive to calculate. Hopefully by the end of the tutorial, you appreciate the simplicity and flexibility this particular package offers. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll import `meep` and `autograd`, a widely used automatic differentiation package. `autograd` wraps around `numpy` and allows us to quickly differentiate functions composed of standard `numpy` routines. This will be especially useful when we want to formulate our objective function."
